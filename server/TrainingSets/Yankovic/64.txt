Sometimes I really want to be alone.
But that's one state I'm never in.
Because I know that I've got millions upon millions.
Of tiny, one-celled organisms living on my skin.
.
(Germs) I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding.
(Germs) But they just come right back.
(Germs) I can't even see 'em, but I know they're up to something.
Hey, don't touch that - you don't know where it's been.
.
They're all over me.
They're inside of me.
Can't get 'em offa me.
I'm covered with ... microscopic bacteria.
What do they want from me.
What'll they do to me.
There's no escape for me.
I'm crawling with ... microscopic bacteria.
.
Now if I ever dare to go to sleep.
That's when they start their sneak attack.
In the morning I wake up in utter horror.
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque.
.
(Germs) Can't get those parasitic creatures off my face.
(Germs) And there's more comin' every day.
(Germs) I never said that they could camp out on my body.
I wish they'd pack their tiny little bags and move away.
.
They're all over me.
They're inside of me.
Can't get 'em offa me.
I'm covered with ... microscopic bacteria.
What do they want from me.
What'll they do to me.
There's no escape for me.
I'm crawling with ... microscopic bacteria.
.
They're creepin' around my shorts.
They're under the bathroom sink.
They're ridin' inside my car.
They're swimmin' in my drink.
They're hidin' between my toes.
They're lurkin' in every kiss.
I got 'em way up my nose.
In every orafice.
I'm gonna show them who's boss.
I'm gonna get even yet.
Just gimme some Lysol spray.
Just hand me a moist towelette.
Don't tell me I'm paranoid.
I know that they're after me.
Look under the microscope.
See??.
.
They're all over me.
They're inside of me.
Can't get 'em offa me.
I'm covered with ... microscopic bacteria.
What do they want from me.
What'll they do to me.
There's no escape for me.
I'm crawling with ... microscopic bacteria.
.
They're all over me.
I can feel 'em all over me.
Over every part of me.
Microscopic bacteria.
I know they're watching me.
They're always watching me.
They're coming after me.
Microscopic bacteria.
Won't somebody help me.
Please somebody help me.
You've got to believe me.
They're out to get me.
They wanna control me.
They wanna destroy me.
They're tryin' to kill me.
It kind of upsets me.
