I'm waking up in Cheeto dust.
My belly's covered with pizza crust.
I'm using my inhaler now [wheezes].
I'm out of shape, fattening up.
I'm sipping Coke from a solo cup.
Donut crumbs are upon my lips, whoa.

The TV's on, I really hate this show.
I can't reach my remote control.
Welcome to my new place, to my new place.
Sorry it's a cramped space, but it's my place.
I'm really inactive, I'm so inactive.
I'm really inactive, highly inactive.

My muscle's gone, I'm atrophied.
Always lose my fight with gravity.
I rest my bones, and just chillax.
My nordictrack's collecting dust.
And my stairmaster's a pile of rust.
This is it, the inertia.

I can't get up, this couch is part of me.
I'm growing cobwebs on my knee.
Pretty sad for my age, sad for my age.
I could read my rib cage, here is my age.
I'm really inactive, yes, quite inactive.
I'm really inactive, not very active.

Near comatose, no exercise.
Don't tag my toe, I'm still alive.

I'm giving up, my energy is shot..
I'm never moving from this spot.
Never move from this place, move from this place.
I'll stay here in this place, right in this place.
I'm really inactive, just so inactive.
I'm really inactive, not so attractive.
