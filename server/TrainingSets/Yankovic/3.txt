Gonna tell you a story.
About Chuck and Diane.
Couple British kids from.
The palace at Buckingham.

Chuckie wants to grow up.
And be a polo star.
And ride his little horsies.
All around the backyard, oh yeah.

You know they really paid their dues.
I said, "Hey, lawdy mama.
They got them Buckingham blues".

Now Chuckie goes hunting.
And leaves Diane alone.
So she fixes her hair.
And she talks on the princess phone.

Chuckie's still tryin' to figure out.
What his job's supposed to be.
And Diane's the fashion leader.
Of the aristocracy.

I said, "Hey, Lady Di.
Tell me where'd you get them shoes, ah.
Well, hey nonny nonny.
Looks like you got them Buckingham blues".

Aw, bein' heir to the throne, well.
It must be awful hard.
Gotta pose for pictures.
Out on the front yard.

And Lady Di, well.
She must have it pretty rough.
Gotta hang around the house all day.
Makin' babies and stuff.

On another game of croquet.
Then they're off on a Caribbean cruise.
Well, hey bop-a-re-bop.
They really got them Buckingham blues.

Ah, tell the truth, now, tell the truth.
Wow.

I got my mojo workin'.
Yeah, woo, don't help me now.
Ah, hurt me, mama, whoa, ah.

They don't serve no Twinkies.
With their afternoon tea.
Never had a dinner.
Made by Chef Boyardee.

Bein' in the spotlight.
Is a hard life to choose.
Diane drops half a pound.
It's on the six o'clock news, oh yeah.

Those kids have really paid their dues.
Oh, what a royal pain it is.
When you got them Buckingham blues.
