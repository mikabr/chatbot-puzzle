Sometimes I feel.
Like I need a vacation.
Sometimes I feel.
Like I wanna go.
To the city of cavemen.
The city of Bedrock.
I'd be a Flintstone.
Now I'll tell you why....
.
Well, I've got I've got a woman named Wilma.
Well, I've got I've got a baby named Pebbles.
Well, I've got I've got a doggy named Dino.
We do a little bowling and we drink a little vino.
.
Well, I've got a little buddy, Barney Rubble.
Got a neighbor by the name of Barney Rubble.
He's a midget but he makes a lot of trouble.
Doesn't like to shave, he got caveman stubble.
.
Me and Barney, Loyal Order Water Buffalo.
Lodge brothers, Loyal Order Water Buffalo.
There's a handshake everybody gotta know.
How come grand Poo-Bah always gotta run the whole show?.
.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
I get by on all my prehistoric knowhow.
.
Betty and Barney got a baby named Bamm-Bamm.
Little Pebbles is his number one fan.
He's the strongest toddler in the whole land.
Tear your arm off if he shakes your hand.
.
Got a car, gonna push it with my feet now.
Gonna take my family out to eat now.
Jumbo ribs at the drive-in can't be beat now.
Made from brontosaurus, baby, not a moo-cow.
.
Wanna chill with a Sabretooth Tiger.
Wear a loincloth, natural fiber.
Be the first Rolling Stone subscriber.
Got a pterodactyl for a windshield wiper.
.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Don't know what it means but I say it anyhow.
.
Lucky me, workin' down in the gravel pit.
Movin' rocks, on a big dinosaur I sit.
Mr. Slate gets mad and he throws a fit.
Pull the birdie's tail, everybody knows it's time to quit.
.
I realize I'm living in the Stone Age.
No fax, no cellular phone age.
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone age.
Liftin' heavy boulders every day for my wage.
.
Barney Rubble, laughin' like a hyena.
Barney Rubble, what a little wiener.
Where's Wilma? Anybody seen her?.
Got a baby elephant vacuum cleaner.
.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
