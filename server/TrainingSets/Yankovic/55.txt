Sometimes I feel.
Like I need a vacation.
Sometimes I feel.
Like I wanna go.
To the city of cavemen.
The city of Bedrock.
I'd be a Flintstone.
Now I'll tell you why....

Well, I've got I've got a woman named Wilma.
Well, I've got I've got a baby named Pebbles.
Well, I've got I've got a doggy named Dino.
We do a little bowling and we drink a little vino.

Well, I've got a little buddy, Barney Rubble.
Got a neighbor by the name of Barney Rubble.
He's a midget but he makes a lot of trouble.
Doesn't like to shave, he got caveman stubble.

Me and Barney, Loyal Order Water Buffalo.
Lodge brothers, Loyal Order Water Buffalo.
There's a handshake everybody gotta know.
How come grand Poo-Bah always gotta run the whole show?

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
I get by on all my prehistoric knowhow.

Betty and Barney got a baby named Bamm-Bamm.
Little Pebbles is his number one fan.
He's the strongest toddler in the whole land.
Tear your arm off if he shakes your hand.

Got a car, gonna push it with my feet now.
Gonna take my family out to eat now.
Jumbo ribs at the drive-in can't be beat now.
Made from brontosaurus, baby, not a moo-cow.

Wanna chill with a Sabretooth Tiger.
Wear a loincloth, natural fiber.
Be the first Rolling Stone subscriber.
Got a pterodactyl for a windshield wiper.

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Don't know what it means but I say it anyhow.

Lucky me, workin' down in the gravel pit.
Movin' rocks, on a big dinosaur I sit.
Mr. Slate gets mad and he throws a fit.
Pull the birdie's tail, everybody knows it's time to quit.

I realize I'm living in the Stone Age.
No fax, no cellular phone age.
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone age.
Liftin' heavy boulders every day for my wage.

Barney Rubble, laughin' like a hyena.
Barney Rubble, what a little wiener.
Where's Wilma?
Got a baby elephant vacuum cleaner.

Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba doo now.
