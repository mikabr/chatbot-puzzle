Everybody shut up, WOO!
Everyone listen up!
Hey, hey, hey, uh.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

If you can't write in the proper way.
If you don't know how to conjugate.
Maybe you flunked that class.
And maybe now you find.
That people mock you online.

Okay, now here's the deal.
I'll try to educate ya.
Gonna familiarize.
You with the nomenclature.
You'll learn the definitions.
Of nouns and prepositions.
Literacy's your mission.
And that's why I think it's a.

Good time.
To learn some grammar.
Now, did I stammer.
Work on that grammar.
You should know when.
It's "less" or it's "fewer".
Like people who were.
Never raised in a sewer.

I hate these word crimes.
Like I could care less.
That means you do care.
At least a little.
Don't be a moron.
You'd better slow down.
And use the right pronoun.
Show the world you're no clown.
Everybody wise up!

Say you got an "I","T".
Followed by apostrophe, "s".
Now what does that mean?
You would not use "it's" in this case.
As a possessive.
It's a contraction.
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word, or a group of words.
By the omission of a sound or letter.

Okay, now here's some notes.
Syntax you're always mangling.
No "x" in "espresso".
Your participle's danglin'.
But I don't want your drama.
If you really wanna.
Leave out that Oxford comma.
Just keep in mind.

That "be", "see", "are", "you".
Are words, not letters.
Get it together.
Use your spellchecker.
You should never.
Write words using numbers.
Unless you're seven.
Or your name is Prince.

I hate these word crimes.
You really need a.
Full time proofreader.
You dumb mouth-breather.
Well, you should hire.
Some cunning linguist.
To help you distinguish.
What is proper English.

One thing I ask of you.
Time to learn your homophones is past due.
Learn to diagram a sentence too.
Always say "to whom".
Don't ever say "to who".
And listen up when I tell you this.
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis.
You finished second grade.
I hope you can tell.
If you're doing good or doing well.
About better figure out the difference.
Irony is not coincidence.
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull.
What's figurative and what's literal.
Oh but, just now, you said.
You literally couldn't get out of bed.
That really makes me want to literally.
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head.

I read your e-mail.
It's quite apparent.
Your grammar's errant.
You're incoherent.
Saw your blog post.
It's really fantastic.
That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!).
'Cause you write like a spastic.

I hate these Word Crimes.
Your prose is dopey.
Think you should only.
Write in emoji.
Oh, you're a lost cause.
Go back to pre-school.
Get out of the gene pool.
Try your best to not drool.

Never mind I give up.
Really now I give up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Go Away!
