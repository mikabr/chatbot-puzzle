I never seem to finish all my food.
I always get a doggie bag from the waiter.
So I just keep what's still unchewed.
And I take it home, save it for later.

But then I deal with fungal rot, bacterial formation.
Microbes, enzymes, mold and oxidation.
I don't care, I've got a secret trick up my sleeve.
I never bother with baggies, glass jars, tupperware containers.
Plastic cling wrap, really a no-brainer.
I just like to keep all my flavours sealed in tight.

With aluminum foil (foil).
Never settle for less.
That kind of wrap is just the best.
To keep your sandwich nice and fresh.
Stick it in your cooler (cooler).
Eat it when you're ready.
But maybe you'll choose (you'll choose, you'll choose, you'll choose).
A refreshing herbal tea.

Mmm, lovely!

Oh, by the way, I've cracked the code.
I've figured out these shadow organizations.
And the Illuminati know.
That they're finally primed for world domination.

And soon you've got black helicopters coming 'cross the border.
Puppet masters for the New World Order.
Be aware: there's always someone that's watching you.
And still the government won't admit they faked the whole moon landing.
Thought control rays, psychotronic scanning.
Don't mind that, I'm protected cause I made this hat.

From aluminum foil (foil).
Wear a hat that's foil lined.
In case an alien's inclined.
To probe your butt or read your mind.
Looks a bit peculiar ('culiar).
Seems a little crazy.
But someday I'll prove (I'll prove, I'll prove, I'll prove).
There's a big conspiracy.
