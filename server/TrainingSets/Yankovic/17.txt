They tell us that we lost our tails.
Evolving up from little snails.
I say it's all just wind and sails.
Are we not men, we are Devo.
Are we not men, D-E-V-O.

Smoke on the water.
A fire in the sky.
Smoke on the water.

(I'm a man) I'm a boy.
(I'm a man) Well, I'm your mother.
(I'm a man) I'm a one night stand.
(I'm a man) Am I bi.
(I'm a man) I'm your slave.
(I'm a man) I'm a little girl when we make love together.

Hey, hey, hey.
Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart.
Then you can start to make it.
Better, better, better, better, better, better, yeah.

L.A. woman.
You're my woman.
Got my mojo risin'.
Mr. Mojo Risin'.
Hey.

In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey.
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby.
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Hey, Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Hey, Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Gonna shoot my old lady.
Caught her messin' 'round with another man.

Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo.
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay he-hoo.
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo.
Yodel-ay-ee, yodel-ay-he-hoo, yodel-ay he-hoo.

I'm an ordinary guy burnin' down the house.

I'm hot blooded, check it and see.
Got a fever of a hundred and three.
Come on, baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded.

Every breath you take.
Every move you make.
Every bond you break, every step you take.
I'll be watchin' you.

Darling, you gotta let me know.
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine.
I'll be here till the end of time.
But you gotta let me know, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Should I stay or should I go?

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas.
But it's all right, Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas.

People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
Singly do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
Hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
This is my generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
This is my generation, baby (Talkin' 'bout my generation).
(Talkin' 'bout my generation).
My, my, my, my, my, my generation (My generation).
Well, I'm talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-generation.

Hey.
