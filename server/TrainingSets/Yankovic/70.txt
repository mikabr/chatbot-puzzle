One time I was in the checkout line.
Behind Steven Seagal.
Once I'm pretty sure Mr. Jonah Hill.
Was in the very next bathroom stall.
My best friend's brother.
Well, he was an extra in Wayne's World 2.
My neighbour's baby sitter.
Dated three of the guys in Motley Crue.
I swear Jack Nicholson.
Looked right at me at a Laker's game.

I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.

Check it out, I bought a second hand toaster .
from a guy who says he knows Brad Pitt.
I got me an email from the prince of Nigeria.
Well, he sure sounded legit.
My sister used to take piano lessons.
From the second cousin of Ralph Nader.
Last year I threw up in an elevator.
Next to Christian Slater.
Well guess what, my birthday and Kim Kardashian's.
Are exactly the same.

I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.
I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.

Once at a party, my dentist accidentally.
Sneezed on Russell Crowe.
I posted first in the comments.
On a YouTube video.
I tried to sit by Steve Buscemi.
But he told me this seat's taken.
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy.
Who know a guy who knows a guy who know Kevin Bacon.

I had a car that used to belong.
To Cuba Gooding Jr.'s uncle.
A friend of mine in high school.
Had jury duty with Art Garfunkel.
One time I was staying in the same hotel.
As Zooey Deschanel.
I used the same napkin dispenser.
As Steve Carell at a Taco Bell.
I don't mean to brag but.
Paul Giamatti's plumber knows me by name.

I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.
I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.
I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.
I got a lame.
Lame claim to fame.

Ow, let's get lame boys.
