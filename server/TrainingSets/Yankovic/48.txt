Where'd you learn how to steer.
You do eighty in second gear.
When you drive, I can't relax.
Got your license from Cracker Jacks.
You just hit another tree.
These fender benders are killin' me.

She drives like crazy.
Like no one else.
She drives like crazy.
And I'm afraid for myself.

They'll put you behind bars.
We're not playin' bumper cars.
Did a great figure eight.
In the middle of the interstate.
Tires squeal wherever we go.
Even hitchhikers just say no.

She drives like crazy.
Her car's a mess.
She drives like crazy.
She's got a death wish I guess.

She's a demon.
Behind the wheel.
Thinks she's drivin'.
The Batmobile.

Burnin' rubber in school zones.
Runnin' over traffic cones.
Passin' "semi-"s on the right.
Now my knuckles are turnin' white.

She drives like crazy.
She'll break our necks.
She drives like crazy.
She always gets into wrecks.

She drives like crazy.
Like no one else.
She drives like crazy.
Now I'm afraid for myself.

She drives like crazy.
Like no one else.
She drives like crazy.
And I'm afraid for myself.
