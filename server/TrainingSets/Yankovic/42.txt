It's Christmas at Ground Zero.
There's music in the air.
The sleigh bells are ringin' and the carolers are singin'.
While the air raid sirens blare.

It's Christmas at Ground Zero.
The button has been pressed.
The radio just let us know.
That this is not a test.

Everywhere the atom bombs are droppin'.
It's the end of all humanity.
No more time for last minute shoppin'.
It's time to face your final destiny.

Well, it's Christmas at Ground Zero.
There's panic in the crowd.
We can dodge debris while we trim the tree.
Underneath a mushroom cloud.

You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop.
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill.
But if someone's climbin' down your chimney.
You better load your gun and shoot to kill.

Oh, it's Christmas at Ground Zero.
And if the radiation level's okay.
I'll go out with you and see the all new.
Mutations on New Year's Day.

It's Christmas at Ground Zero.
Just seconds left to go.
I'll duck and cover with my yuletide lover.
Underneath the mistletoe.

It's Christmas at Ground Zero.
Now the missiles are on their way.
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked.
On this jolly holiday.
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked.
On this jolly holiday.
