I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah.
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda.
S O D A, soda.

I saw the little runt sitting there on a log.
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said "Yoda".
Y O D A, Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen.
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green.
Oh, my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand.
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand.
Oh, my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

Well, I left home just a week before.
And I've never ever been a Jedi before.
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course.
He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force".

Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben.
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again.
With my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

So I used the Force.
I picked up a box.
I lifted some rocks.
While I stood on my head.
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said.

He said, "Luke, stay away from the darker side.
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide".
Oh, my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

"I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed.
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed".
Oh, my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.

Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess.
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda I guess.
But I know that I'll be coming back some day.
I'll be playing this part 'till I'm old and gray.

The long-term contract I had to sign.
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time.
With my Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yoda Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda.
