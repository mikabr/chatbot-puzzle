They only show you their gums when they smile.
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now how vile.
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce.
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss.

Hey, stand up.
Toothless people, the breath is lethal.
Wanna tell ya.

Hey, (come on), stand up, (get on your feet).
Toothless people, old and feeble.
What I say.

No more of those pearly whites will they posses.
Their oral hygiene is frightful a mess.
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease.
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities.

Hey, stand up, (take out your teeth).
Toothless people, old and feeble.
Oh yes.

You can brush 'em. You can floss 'em .
They're something you just can't ignore.
If you lose 'em your in trouble.
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more.

You need something to show your dentist.
The next time he makes you say ahh.
You don't wanna have to wind up.
Eating all of your food through a straw.

(Like toothless people).
(Toothless people).

You better brush your teeth now.
Hey.
Toothless toothless toothless toothless peopleâ€¦.
