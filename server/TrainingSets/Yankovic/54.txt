We're dangerous dudes, we got bad attitudes.
Most of our brain cells are gone.
We were born to be bad, you better not make us mad.
Or we just might toilet paper your lawn.
We got a reputation 'round these parts.
We only leave a ten percent tip.
Sometimes we don't return our shoping carts.
Stay out of our way and don't you give us no lip.

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly.
That's what we are.
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly.

We wear black leather in the hottest weather.
You can't imagine the smell.
We got three-day stubble, our names spell trouble.
T-R-U-B-E-L.
Reaisin' hell, bendin' the rules just a little.
We're livin' only for thrills.
We squeeze our tooothpaste tubes from the middle.
And wait until the last minute to pay our telephone bills.

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly.
You better believe it.
We're young... young, dumb and ugly.
I'll tell you again.
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly.
We're comin' to your town.
Yeah, we're young... young, dumb and ugly.

We're wild, reckless men, we're on a rampage again.
We drive with just one hand on the wheel.
Danger's in our soul, we're goin' out of control.
Swimmin' right after a big heavy meal.
We're there wherever trouble's starting.
We're rebels without a clue.
We drink milk right from the carton.
And keep our library books 'till they're way overdue.

'Cause we're young... dumb and ugly.
That's what we are.
We're so young... young, dumb and ugly.
You can't stop us.
We're young... we're so young, dumb and ugly.
Young, dumb & ugly.
We're young... we're young, dumb and ugly.
So ugly.
Young... dumb... & ugly.
