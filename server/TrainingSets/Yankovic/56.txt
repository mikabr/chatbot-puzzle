There's something weird in the fridge today.
I don't know what it is.
Food I can't recognize.
My roommate won't throw a thing away.
I guess it's probably his.
It looks like it's alive....

And livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge.
Livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge.

There's something gross in the fridge today.
It's green and growin' hair.
It's been there since July.
If you can name the object.
In that baggie over there.
Then mister, you're a better man than I.

It's livin' in the fridge.
You can't stop (dysentary) the mold from growin' (dysentary) .
Livin' in the fridge.
Can't tell what (dysentary) it is at all (dysentary).
Livin' in the fridge.
You can't stop (dysentary) the mold from growin' (dysentary) .
Livin' in the fridge.

Tell me, do you think it should be carbon dated.
Fumigated or creamated and buried at sea?
You try to save a little bit of you're home cookin'.
Couple weeks later, got a scary-lookin' specimen.
It always happens my friend.
Again & again & again & again.

Somethin' stinks in the fridge today.
And it's been rottin' there all week.
It could be liver cake or wooly mammoth steak.
Well, maybe I should another peek....

Livin' in the fridge.
You can't stop (dysentary) the mold from growin' (dysentary) .
Livin' in the fridge.
Can't tell what (dysentary) it is at all (dysentary).
Livin' in the fridge.
You can't stop (dysentary) the mold from growin' (dysentary) .
Livin' in the fridge.
Livin' in the fridge.
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is.
Livin' in the fridge.
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is.
Livin' in the fridge.
Don't know what it is at all.
Livin' in the fridge, yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
