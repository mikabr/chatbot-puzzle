I was there to match my intellect on national TV.
Against a plumber, oh and an architect, both with a PhD .
I was tense, I was nervous, I guess it just wasn't my night.
Art Flemming gave the answers.
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right-ight-ight.
.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
.
Well, I knew I was in trouble now.
My hope of winning sank.
Oh, 'cause I got the Daily Double.
And then my mind went blank.
I took Potpourri for one hundred.
And then my head started to spin.
Well, I'm given up Don Pardo.
Just tell me now what I didn't win, yeah, yeah.
.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
.
[Spoken].
That's right Al -- you lost..
And let me tell you what you didn't win: a twenty set volume of the Encyclopedia International,.
a case of Turtle Wax, and a years supply of Rice-A-Roni, the San Fransisco treat..
But that's not all, you also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people..
You brought shame and disgrace to your family name for generations to come..
You don't get to come back tomorrow..
You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game..
You're a complete loser!.
.
Don't know what I was thinkin' of.
I guess I just wasn't to bright.
Well, I sure hope I do better.
Next weekend on the Price Is Right-ight-ight.
.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby, ooh.
I lost on Jeopardy, baby.
