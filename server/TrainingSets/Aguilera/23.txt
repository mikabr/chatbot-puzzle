Ohh yeah.
Mmmm.
Yeah, oh yeah, oh oh.
Oh yeah.

I was alone just because.
I wasn't like them.
They made me, excluded so cruel, and.
Then there was you.
You stood by me, ignored their words.
You became, my best friend so true, oh yeah.

You believed in me.
When no one else did.
You gave me the strength to.
Move on, my friend.
You will always be.
The one I remember.
To give my thanks to.
For my success.

They just did not understand.
What I was going through.
My situation, they didn't care, no.
You tried to take a stand for me.
When I just could not.
Take it any longer.

You believed in me.
When no one else did.
You gave me the strength to.
Move on, my friend.
You will always be.
The one I remember.
To give my thanks to.
For my success.

I ohh, as I look back.
I can see how childish they were.
And you ohh, you showed me that.
We were so much more than they were.
I hope they can see their mistakes now.
And not do it to another.
But if they don't, I hope that person.
Finds someone like you.

Ohh....
You believed in me.
When no one else did.
Yeah ohh, no, ohh yeah, oh.

You will always be.
The one I remember.
Will always be the one I remember, oh no.
For my success.
For my, for my success, ohh.

You believed in me.
When no one else did, ohh yeah.
Ohh, the strength to move on, yeah.
The one I remember, oh.
With all my heart, yeah.
