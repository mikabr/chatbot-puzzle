Ohh yeah
Mmmm
Yeah, oh yeah, oh oh
Oh yeah

I was alone just because
I wasn't like them
They made me, excluded so cruel, and
Then there was you
You stood by me, ignored their words
You became, my best friend so true, oh yeah

You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success

They just did not understand
What I was going through
My situation, they didn't care, no
You tried to take a stand for me
When I just could not
Take it any longer

You believed in me
When no one else did
You gave me the strength to
Move on, my friend
You will always be
The one I remember
To give my thanks to
For my success

I ohh, as I look back
I can see how childish they were
And you ohh, you showed me that
We were so much more than they were
I hope they can see their mistakes now
And not do it to another
But if they don't, I hope that person
Finds someone like you

Ohh...
You believed in me
When no one else did
Yeah ohh, no, ohh yeah, oh

You will always be
The one I remember
Will always be the one I remember, oh no
For my success
For my, for my success, ohh

You believed in me
When no one else did, ohh yeah
Ohh, the strength to move on, yeah
The one I remember, oh
With all my heart, yeah
