You'll be my New Year's Day, my Valentine.
Now I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine.
You'll be my April Fool, my Mardi Gras.
The music on my tongue when I sing fa la la.
.
You'll be my flower child, in the month of May.
My sunny summer lover on my holiday.
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween.
The winter snow and everything that's in between.
This year I'm gonna take you home.
This year I don't wanna be alone.
.
This year, this Christmas together.
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly.
This year, this Christmas forever.
And the weeks and the months go rushing by.
This year we've learned how to live.
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear, oh.
Just love this Christmas, this year.
.
Oh, you'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind.
The shimmy on my hips oh when I, bump and grind.
You'll be my Santa Boy, all dressed in red.
And ride that little reindeer all through my head.
Oh, ooh, here we go, oh yeah.
This year I'm gonna take you home.
This year I don't wanna be alone.
.
This year, this Christmas together.
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly.
This year, this Christmas forever.
And the weeks and the months go rushing by.
This year we've learned how to live.
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear, oh.
Just love this Christmas, this year.

This year I'll pray for you, uh.
And I thank God for you.
Just wanna be with you.
This year that's all I wanna do.

Day by day, I'm gonna get my way.
This year I'll pray for you.
The seasons turn, I've got a lot to learn.
And I thank God for you.
Now this year I'm gonna, gonna, gonna take you home.
Cause I don't wanna be alone.
