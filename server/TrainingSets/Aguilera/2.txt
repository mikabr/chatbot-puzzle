What a girl wants, what a girl needs.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs.

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe .
Like a rock you waited so patiently .
While I got it together .
While I figured it out, yeah yeah.
I only looked but I never touched .
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us .
Holdin' hands, makin' plans and it's lucky for me you understand .

What a girl wants .
What a girl needs .
Whatever makes me happy sets you free .
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly .
What a girl wants .
What a girl needs .
Whatever keeps me in your arms .
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me.
Yeah Yeah .

What I want is what you got.
And what you got, is what I want..

There was a time I was blind, I was so confused.
Run away just to hide it all from you..
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself .
They say if you love something let it go .
If it comes back it's yours .
That's how you know .
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure .
And you're ready and willin' .
To give me more than .

Sexy, cool, like you. .
