What a girl wants, what a girl needs. [2x]
Yeah, come on.

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe 
Like a rock you waited so patiently 
While I got it together 
While I figured it out, yeah yeah
I only looked but I never touched 
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us 
Holdin' hands, makin' plans and it's lucky for me you understand 

What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly 
What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah 

What I want is what you got
And what you got, is what I want.

There was a time I was blind, I was so confused
Run away just to hide it all from you.
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself 
They say if you love something let it go 
If it comes back it's yours 
That's how you know 
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure 
And you're ready and willin' 
To give me more than 

What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah 

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Somebody sensitive, courageous, 
Sexy, cool, like you. 
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, oh yeah.

What a girl wants (you're so right)
What a girl needs (you're so right)
You let a girl know how much you 
Care about her, I swear
You're the one who always knew... 
You knew, you knew, you knew, you knew...

Ooh, I'm thanking you for being there for me.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms,
Whatever keeps me in your arms, that's what I need...

What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever makes me happy sets you free 
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly 
What a girl wants 
What a girl needs 
Whatever keeps me in your arms 
And I'm thanking you for being there for me 
Yeah Yeah
