Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria.
Yeah, ooh, oh, ooh oh, yeah.

Angels we have heard on high.
Sweetly singing o'er the plain.
And the mountains in reply.
Echoing their joyous strains.

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria.
In excelsis Deo.

Ooh, no, yeah, yeah.
Shepards, why this jubilee.
Why your joyous song prolong.
What the gladsome tidings be, ohh.
That inspire your heavenly, heavenly song, oh.

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria.
In excelsis Deo.

Oh oh oh, oh yeah.
Oh, come to Bethlehem and see.
Him whose birth the angels sing, oh.
Come on adore on bended knee.
Christ, the Lord, our newborn King.

Glo-glo-glo-glo-ria.
In excelsis Deo.
Oh yeah.

On the day, that Christ was born.
The angels sang such a heavenly song.
In excelsis Deo, ohh.

Angels we have heard on high.
Angels we have heard on high.
Angels we have heard on high.
Angels we have heard on high.
In excelsis Deo.
In excelsis Deo.

In excelsis Deo.
