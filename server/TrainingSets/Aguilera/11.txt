No one ever said that.
Love was gonna be easy .
Gotta take the ups and downs.
The in-betweens .
If you take this journey.
Gotta give yourself completely .
Never let nobody ever step on our dreams.

You better stop .
Listen to these words that I say.
You better stop .
Don't you throw this good thing away.
No, no.
Put your trust in me.
And I'll make you see .

No the rain won't last forever .
Find a way to make it better .
Long as we can stand together .
Love will find a way .
Gonna make a new tomorrow .
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow .
Better listen when I say .
'Love will find a way' .

Somebody tried to tell me love.
Don't last forever .
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams .
After all is said and done.
We're still here together .
Never listen to the lies and jealousy.

You better stop .
Don't you let them turn you around .
You better stop .
Hang onto this love that we've found .
Nothing they can say .
Can stand in our way .

No the rain won't last forever .
Find a way to make it better .
Long as we can stand together .
Love will find a way .
Gonna make a new tomorrow .
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow .
Better listen when I say .
'Love will find a way' .

I want you.
I need you.
You know that I believe you.
We got it.
You know it.
So if it's real.
Just show it.
