You know tonight.
I'm feeling a little out of control.
Is this me.
You wanna get crazy.
Cause I don't give a....

I'm out of character.
I'm in rare form.
If you really knew me.
You'd know it's not the norm.

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do.
The old me's gone I feel brand new.
And if you don't like it fuck you.

The music's on and I'm dancing.
I'm normally in the corner just standing.
I'm feeling unusual.
I don't care cause this is my night.

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

I'm dancing a lot.
I'm taking shots.
And I'm feeling fine.

I'm kissing all the boys and girls.
Someone call the doctor cause I lost my mind.

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do.
The old me's gone I feel brand new.
And if you don't like it fuck you.

The music's on and I'm dancing.
I'm normally in the corner just standing.
I'm feeling unusual.
I don't care cause this is my night.

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

In the morning.
When I wake up.
I'll go back to the girl I used to be.
But baby.
Not tonight.

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

I'm not myself tonight.
Tonight I'm not the same girl (same girl).

Get crazy.
Let's go.

Give it to me now.
Don't stop.
Yeah.
