Come on, come on.
Ohh, whow.

I feel like I've been locked up tight.
For a century of lonely nights.
Waiting for someone to release me.
You're lickin' your lips.
And blowing kisses my way.
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away.
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby...).

Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go.
Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no.

If you wanna be with me.
Baby there's a price to pay.
I'm a genie in a bottle.
You gotta rub me the right way.

If you wanna be with me.
I can make your wish come true.
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah).
Gotta like what you do.

(I'm a genie in a bottle baby.
Gotta rub me the right way honey.
I'm a genie in a bottle baby.
Come come, come on and let me out).

The music's fading and the lights down low.
Just one more dance and then we're good to go.
Waiting for someone.
Who needs me.
Hormones racing at the speed of light.
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight.
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby...).

Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go.
Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no (but my heart is sayin' no).

If you wanna be with me.
Baby there's a price to pay.
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle).
You gotta rub me the right way.

If you wanna be with me (Ohh).
I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true ohh).
Just come and set me free baby.
And I'll be with you.

(I'm a genie in a bottle baby.
Gotta rub me the right way honey.

Come come, come on and let me out).
