This is the moment that I take over your mind frame.
Step into the picture that I paint using my brain game.
I'll elevate you so high I'll give you a migraine.
Over and over, put it on replay, 'til you're insane.
This is a rollercoaster that's about to be long gone.
Once you jump in, we're gonna get up on the lump and hold on.
Just let it go, give it up, allow yourself to transform.
Follow me, follow me to a place I know of no return.

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?
Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh.
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh.
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh.
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh.

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh.
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh.
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh.
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh.

I-I-I-I-I am the future, put it on you like a hurricane.
Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space.
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create.
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make.
Many times imitated, not duplicated; can't be replaced.
Na-na-now, lemme spell it out, everybody can shout my name.

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh.
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh.
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh.
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh.

(Bi-on-ic).

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh.
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh.
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh.
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh.

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh.
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh.
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh.
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh.

Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh.
