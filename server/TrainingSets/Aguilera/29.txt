Tossing and turning makes my appetite keep growing stronger.
All night long.
Anticipating morning, lying I can't wait much longer.
Feels so strong.

Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough.
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh.
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs.
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh.

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind.
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside.
And even though we made sweet love all night.
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right.

Might be late for work, but I promise that it's worth it baby.
Don't go.
So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you.
There's no stopping what I'll do to get you in the mood.

Our bodies touching, I just can't get enough.
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh.
Won't let you sleep, want you deep inside of me.
So I can love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh.

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind.
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside.
And even though we made sweet love all night.
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right.

And I can see break of day beging through the curtains.
And I'm so certain, soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip my juices start to flow.
Strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality.
When the morning comes, I know that I will too.

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind.
I need sex for breakfast, stay inside.
And even though we made sweet love all night.
I need sex for breakfast, feels so right.

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind.
Sex for breakfast (I need it, I want it), stay inside (when the morning comes).
And even though that we made sweet love all night.
Sex for breakfast, feels so right.

So hungry for you.
Taste me, and I'll taste you.
Sex for breakfast.
All done.

Sex for breakfast (feels so right).
