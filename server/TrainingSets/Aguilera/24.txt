Can you feel it, feel the groove.
Let the music take control.
And let your body move.
Just relax, oh and listen to the sound.
Once the music takes you.
You will finally have found.
It will take, you away.
To another state of mind.
Where peace you'll find inside the sound.
Just escape, to a place.
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away.

Get this party going on.
The feel of the rhythm.
Gotta, gotta make it strong.
Leave it going on.
If you wanna get away.
And ease your mind now.
Come on everybody stay.
And let the song.
Take you away, yeah.

Alright.
