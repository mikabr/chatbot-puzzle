But I wanted to believe you, trust you.
You said you wouldn't lie.
But, baby, you were so good, so good.
You had me going blind.
You said it was your best friend, I'm guessing.
I wasn't your type, hey.

What goes around comes around.
And if it goes up, it comes down.
I know you're mad 'cause I found out.
Want you to feel what I feel right now.
Now that it's over.

I just wanna break your heart right back, right back.
Want you to cry me a river.

All this time I was blind.
Running around telling everybody.

You said I was your best, would be your last.
Now he's gone, you're alone.
Don't want you back.
You're telling me you're sorry.
Well, sorry, I'm over it.
'Cause I've already been there, done that.
Ain't doing this again, no.

Want you to cry me a river.

Don't understand how to spell it out for ya.
Yes, I'm a 'G', from the 'A', and they ask 'Y'.
Sorry had to tell you I'm a nice guy.
