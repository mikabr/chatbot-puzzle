Baby, I got love for thee.
So deep inside of me.
I don't know where to start.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).
I love you more than anything.
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).
No, no.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane.
The words don't ever come out right.
I get all tongue-tied and twisted.
I can't explain what I'm feeling.
And I say, baby, baby,
Oh, woah, oh, woah,
Baby, baby.

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby.
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I.
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby.
But every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa).

Baby, I'm so down for you.
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,).
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).
Oh, baby.
See Baby, I been feelin' you.
Before I even knew what feelings were about.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,).
Oh, baby.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy.
Words don't ever come out right.
I get all tongue-tied and twisted.
I can't explain what I'm feeling.
And I say Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa).
Baby.

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby.
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I.
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything (baby).
But every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa).
Baby, baby.

Straight up you got me.
All in, how could I not be,
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know).
If it's even possible, I love you more.
Than the word love can say it (say it).
It's better not explaining.
That's why I keep saying....

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby.
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I.
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby.
But every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa).
Baby, baby.

(Baby I) oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby.
(Baby I) oh, baby, baby I.
(Baby I) all I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby.
But every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Every time I try to say it.
Words, they only complicate it.
Baby, baby (oh, whoa, oh, whoa).
Baby, baby.
