She got a body like an hourglass, but I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac, but I can send you into overdrive (oh)
(You've been waiting for that, stop, hold up, swing your bat)
See anybody could be bad to you,
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah

[Hook - Jessie J:]
Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til ya (ah)

[Verse 2 - Ariana Grande:]
She mighta let you hold her hand in school, but I'mma show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk, just come and show me what your mamma gave (oh, yeah)
(You've got a very big shhhh, mouth but don't say a thing)
See anybody could be good to you,
You need a bad girl to blow your mind

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nicki Minaj:]
(You know what girls?
Let me show you how to do)
It's Myx Moscato
It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle
It's oh, oh
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam, so
Kitten so good
It's dripping on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could
Go, Batman robbin' it
Bang, bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me they sorry
Ride us up like a Harley
Then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hanging we banging
Phone ranging, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing (uh)

B to the A to the N to the G to the uh (baby)
B to the A to the N to the G to the hey

See anybody could be good to you,
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind)

[Hook]

[Outro - Nicki Minaj (overlapping):]
Bang, bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'till ya (ah)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, I said
Bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Jessie J:]
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til ya (ah)
