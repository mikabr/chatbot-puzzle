Realize you and I are in the same boat, same boat, yeah.
Kills me, how you love me then you.
Cut me down, I'll do the same.
We've been living like angels and devils, devils.

I'm loving the pain.
I never wanna live without it.
So why do we try?
You drive me insane.
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder.
So why do we try?
You got me like (na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, na na na na na na) (oh, yeah).

You and I redefine being lovesick, lovesick, lovesick.
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip, heart skip, oh yeah.
Even when you're yelling at me.
I still think you're beautiful.
Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip.

I'm loving the pain.
I never wanna live without it.
So why do we try?
You drive me insane.
