Riding round in my Cadillac.
Thinking bout the day that I first saw you.
Nothing compares to what we had.
And baby that won't change.
I want you babe.
I still want you.
I still want you.
You, yeah.

Summer days with my honey.
Worried bout not a thing.
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze.
Who knew that kiss was the last one.
Never thought we would change.
Baby I'm missing you.

Oh we should've been forever but fell apart.
Might have separated but you took my heart.
Always knew I wasn't really over us.
And sometimes I catch myself.

I want you babe.
I still want you.
I still want you.
You, yeah.

Memories last forever.
So how could I just forget.
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent.

Oh we should've been forever but fell apart.
Might have separated but you took my heart.
Always knew I wasn't really over us.
And sometimes I catch myself.

You, yeah.
