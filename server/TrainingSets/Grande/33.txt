Riding round in my Cadillac.
Thinking bout the day that I first saw you.
Nothing compares to what we had.
And baby that won't change.
I want you babe.
I still want you.
I still want you.
You, yeah.
.
Summer days with my honey.
Worried bout not a thing.
Back in the day when things were easier than the breeze.
Who knew that kiss was the last one.
Never thought we would change.
Baby I'm missing you.
.
Oh we should've been forever but fell apart.
Might have separated but you took my heart.
Always knew I wasn't really over us.
And sometimes I catch myself.

Memories last forever.
So how could I just forget.
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent.
