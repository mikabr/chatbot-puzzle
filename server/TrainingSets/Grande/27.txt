I don't ever ask you where you've been.
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with.
I can't even think straight, but I can tell.
That you were just with her.
And I'll still be a fool.
I'm a fool for you.

Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for.

I don't ever tell you how I really feel.
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean.
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say.
I know I'm not your only.
But I'll still be a fool.
Cause I'm a fool for you.

Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for.

(Just a little bit).
(Mmm, yeah yeah yeah yeah).

I know I'm not your only.
But at least I'm one.
I heard a little love.
Is better than none.

(Oh, babe).

Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for.

Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want.
Just a little bit of your heart (just a little bit).
Just a little bit of your heart.
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for.
