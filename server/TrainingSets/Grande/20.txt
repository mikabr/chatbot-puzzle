I was a liar.
I gave into the fire.
I know I should've fought it.
At least I'm being honest.
Feel like a failure.
'Cause I know that I failed you.
I should've done you better.
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on).

And I know, and I know, and I know.
She gives you everything but, boy, I couldn't give it to you.
And I know, and I know, and I know.
That you got everything.
But I got nothing here without you.

So one last time.
I need to be the one who takes you home.
One more time.
I promise after that, I'll let you go.
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart.
All I really care is you wake up in my arms.
One last time.
I need to be the one who takes you home.

I don't deserve it.
I know I don't deserve it.
But stay with me a minute.
I swear I'll make it worth it.
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily.
I know that this is my fault.
I should've been more careful (come on).

And I know, and I know, and I know.
She gives you everything but, boy, I couldn't give it to you.
And I know, and I know, and I know.
That you got everything.
But I got nothing here without you, baby.

So one last time.
I need to be the one who takes you home.
One more time.
I promise after that, I'll let you go.
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart.
All I really care is you wake up in my arms.
One last time.
I need to be the one who takes you home.

I know I shouldn't fight it.
At least I'm being honest.
But stay with me a minute.
I swear I'll make it worth it.
'Cause I don't want to be without you.

I need to be the one who takes you home.
