Miley: we've been through so so much, no matter

what we do we'll always be friends

 Mitchel: ever since we met each other it hasn't been the same, oh and that feeling will never 

change                        

 

Both (chorus): you make me get goosebumps on my arms, you make my heart jump up and down, your the creeper, your the creeper of my heart


 Mitchel: finally we can stop pretending, because

this feeling won't go away no no

 Miley: finally we can go out and not worry about the press and the paparazzi yeah yeah


 Both (repeat chorus)


 Miley: boy look what you've done to me

 Mitchel: girl you've done all of that to me

too


 Both: oh your the best, the best, the best oh yeah oh and here's how the story goes

 

 Miley: (repeat chorus) oo boy


Mitchel: (repeat chorus) hey girl
