We've been through so so much, no matter what we do we'll always be friends.
Ever since we met each other it hasn't been the same, oh and that feeling will never change.
You make me get goosebumps on my arms, you make my heart jump up and down, your the creeper, your the creeper of my heart.
Finally we can stop pretending, because this feeling won't go away no no.
Finally we can go out and not worry about the press and the paparazzi yeah yeah.
Boy look what you've done to me.
Girl you've done all of that to me too.
Oh your the best, the best, the best oh yeah oh and here's how the story goes.
