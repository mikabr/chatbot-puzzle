I Have played my part.
To show who I am.
For as I leave you.
But now I'm gone.
To find my hope.
To find my peace In My Heart.
As I Cry To you.
For the things I said.
To hurt you.
I come to you and say.
I'm Sorry for what I said.
But Now It's over for me.
For I Have played my part
As I Cry To you.
For letting you down.
And I know it hurts.
To see you go somewhere else.
But Now It's over for me.
For I Have played my part.
I know you still here.
But I'm not.
But Now It's over for me.
For I Have played my part.
Oh played my part.
I will miss you when I'm gone.
When I'm gone.
I Have played my part.
To show who I am.
For as I leave you.
But now I'm gone.
To find my hope.
To find my peace In My Heart.
