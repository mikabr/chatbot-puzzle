I Have played my part

To show who I am

For as I leave you

But now Im gone

To find my hope

To find my peace In My Heart


Chorus

As I Cry To you 

For the things I said 

To hurt you  

I come to you and say

Im Sorry for what I said

But Now Its over for me 

For I Have played my part

(Repeat 1st Verse)


Chorus2

As I Cry To you 

For letting you down

And I know it hurts 

To see you go somewhere else

But Now Its over for me 

For I Have played my part


Mm

I know you still here 

But Im not 

But Now Its over for me 

For I Have played my part

Oh played my part

I will miss you when Im gone

When Im gone

Final Chorus (Choruses 1&2)

My part

Mm

My part 

My part

My part


I Have played my part

To show who I am

For as I leave you

But now Im gone

To find my hope

To find my peace In My Heart
