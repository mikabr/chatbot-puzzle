I saw you at the corner of my eye.
I looked at you and I new that you were he one for me cuz I new strait away that I saw you before.
But I did not recognize you but when I looked inside your eyes.
I new that I Have never talked to you before.
Today is the that I need to face my fear.
I went and said hello yeah yeah yeah.
