We sign our cards and letters BFF.
You've got a million ways to make me laugh.
You're lookin' out for me, you've got my back.
So good to have you around.
You know the secrets I could never tell.
And when I'm quiet you break through my shell.
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell.
'Cause you keep my feet on the ground.
You're a true friend.
You're here till the end.
You pull me aside when something ain't right.
Talk with me now and into the night.
'Til it's alright again.
You're a true friend.
You don't get angry when I change the plans.
Somehow you're never out of second chances.
Won't say I told you when I'm wrong again.
I'm so lucky that I've found.
A true friend.
You're here till the end.
You pull me aside when something ain't right.
Talk with me now and into the night.
'Til it's alright again.
True friends will go to the ends of the earth.
Till they find the things you need.
Friends hang on through the ups and the downs.
Cause they've got someone to believe in.
A true friend.
You're here till the end.
You pull me aside when something ain't right.
Talk with me now and into the night.
No need to pretend.
You're a true friend.
You're a true friend.
You're here till the end.
You pull me aside when something ain't right.
Talk with me now and into the night.
'Till it's alright again.
You're a true friend.
You're a true friend.
You're a true friend.
