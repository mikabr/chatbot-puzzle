I'm more than just your average girl.
I'd like to turn me up and show the world.
Aw, yea.
'Cuz some can talk the talk.
But this girl just wants to rock.
I'm individual.
I'm not like anyone.
I can be glamorous.
Just like you see in all the magazines.
I can be cool as ice.
Or anything I wanna be.
Who said, who said I can't be Superman?
I say, I say that I know I can.
Who said, who said, I won't be President?
I say, I say, you ain't seen nothin' yet
Aw yea, yea!
Go on and make some noise.
Every girl has her choice.
To lead their own parade.
I do it my way.
Oww!
I can be soft and sweet.
Or louder than the radio.
I can be sophisticated, or totally good, out of control.
Who said, who said I can't be Superman?
I say, I say That I know I can.
Who said, who said I'm not electrifying?
I say, I say there's no holding back.
Stayin' right on track.
'Cuz you control the game.
So let 'em know your name.
No limitations on imagination.
Imaginate!
Yea!
Who said, who said I can't be worldwide?
I say, I say time is on my side
Who said, who said I can't be ten feet tall?
I say, I say that I can have it all
Who said, who said I can't be Superman?
I say, I say that I know I can.
Who said, who said I won't be president?
I say, I say you ain't seen nothin' yet.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Whoa, yea.
Who said?
Come on, yea.
That's right!
