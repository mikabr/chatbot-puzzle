I'm more than just

Your average girl

I'd like to turn me up

And show the world

Aw, yea


'Cuz some can talk the talk

But this girl just wants to rock

I'm individual

I'm not like anyone


I can be glamorous

Just like you see in all the magazines

I can be cool as ice

Or anything I wanna be


Who said, who said

I can't be Superman?

I say, I say

That I know I can


Who said, who said

I won't be President?

I say, I say

You ain't seen nothin' yet

Aw yea, yea!


Go on and make some noise

Every girl has her choice

To lead their own parade

I do it my way

Oww!


I can be soft and sweet

Or louder than the radio

I can be sophisticated

Or totally good

Out of control


Who said, who said

I can't be Superman?

I say, I say

That I know I can


Who said, who said

I'm not electrifying?

I say, I say


There's no holding back

Stayin' right on track

'Cuz you control the game

So let ?em know your name

No limitations on imagination

Imaginate!

Yea!


Who said, who said

I can't be worldwide?

I say, I say

Time is on my side


Who said, who said

I can't be 10 feet tall?

I say, I say

That I can have it all


Who said, who said

I can't be Superman?

I say, I say

That I know I can


Who said, who said

I won't be president?

I say, I say

You ain't seen nothin' yet

You ain't seen nothin' yet


Whoa, yea

Who said?

Come on, yea

That's right!
