If you're looking for love.
Know that love don't live here anymore.
He left with my heart.
They both walked through that door, without me.
If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else.
Cause I surely can't help you.
I'm hurting myself.
I've turned into someone else.
I used to believe the comfort.
That's what seen in movies.
Come to find out it's not like that at all.
You see real life's much different.
I don't want to see you go.
Only want to see you smile.
It hurts so much just thinking of.
Felt like this for awhile.
I can't stand to see you there.
We cried we lied.
Cannot pretend to change the fact.
That what we had could make us feel alive again.
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope.
Tell me that now is not the end.

I've turned into someone else.
I used to believe love conquers all.
Cause that's what I felt when you held me.
I thought you'd catch me if I fall.
And fill me up when I'm empty.
I don't want to see you go.
Only want to see you smile.
It hurts so much just thinking of.
Felt like this for awhile.
I can't stand to see you there.

Love is patient.
Love is selfless.
Love is hopeful.
Love is god.
Love is jealous.
Love is selfish.
Love is helpless.
Love is blind.
