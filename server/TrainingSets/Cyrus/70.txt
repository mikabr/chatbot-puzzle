I always knew this day would come.
We'd be standing one by one.
With our future in our hands.
So many dreams so many plans.
Always knew after all these years there'd be laughter there'd be tears.
But never thought that I'd walk away.
With so much joy but so much pain.
And it's so hard to say goodbye.
But yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad I got to know ya.
The times that we had I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Nananananana.
Another chapter in the book cant go back but you can look.
And there we are on every page.
Memories I'll always save.
Up ahead on the open doors.
Who knows what were heading towards?
I wish you love I wish you luck.
For you the world just opens up.
But it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad I got to know ya.
The times that we had I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Everyday that we had all the good all the bad.
I'll keep them here inside.
All the times we shared every place everywhere.
You touched my life.
Yeah one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh.
But right now we just cry.
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterdays gone we gotta keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments so glad I got to know ya.
The times that we had I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Nanananana.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
