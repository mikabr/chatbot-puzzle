Woah, Woah, (Woah) Oh Oh, Woah, Woah.
When I saw you over there, I didnt mean to stare.
But my mind was everywhere.
I wanna know you.
Girl I guess that you're the kind to say whats on their mind.
But you listen when I have something to show you.
There's a mark above your eye.
You got it in July.
Fighting for your sisters reputation.
You remember people's names.
And valentines are lame.
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh.
Woah, Woah, Oh Oh, Woah, Woah.
I wanna know you.
Woah, Woah, Oh Oh, Woah, Oh.
I wanna go there.
where you go.
I wanna find out what you know.
And maybe someday down the road I'll sit back and say to myself yeah, I thought so.
You smile and never shout.
you stand out in a crowd.
you make the best of every situation.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Your fragile and your strong.
a beautiful, and perfect combination, yeahhh.
Whoa, Whoa, Oh Oh, Whoa, Oh.
I wanna know you.
Whoa, Whoa, Oh Oh, Whoa, Oh.
I wanna go there.
where you go.
I wanna find out what you know.
And maybe someday down the road, I'll sit back and say to myself.
I like how you are with me, in our future history.
And maybe someday down the road.
I'll sit back and say to myself yeah, I thought so, I thought so.
Whoa, yeah, yeah.
