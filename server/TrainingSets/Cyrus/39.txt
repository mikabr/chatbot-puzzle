I been in a rut, back and forth enough.
Heart like a wheel.
Without you around.
So uncomfortable is how it feels.
Every time you're near trouble disappears.
Under the ground.
But when you go too far.
Silver clouds'll start hanging around.
And I know I try to run.
But I keep on coming back full circle.
And I can't jump the track.
Can't let you go-o-o-o.
Tied to one.
So I keep on coming back full circle.
'Cause I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
Skipping down a broken path.
How long can I last? Please let me know, oh.
Where's the finish line?
'Cause I got to find somewhere to go.
I don't wanna hear those people interfere.
What do they know?
What I feel inside when I'm up all night.
Needing you home.
I don't know why I try to run.
But I keep on coming back full circle.
And I can't jump the track.
Can't let you go-o-o-o.
Tied to one.
So I keep on coming back full circle.
'Cause I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
'Cause I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
I'll keep on running till we meet in the middle.
I'll put right aside and I'll give just a little.
There's miles to go but we both know that we'll make it.
And I know I try to run.
But I keep on coming back full circle.
And I can't jump the track.
Can't let you go-o.
Tied to one.
So I keep on coming back full circle.
'Cause I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
Yeah, I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
Yeah, I know you'll come around.
You'll come around.
