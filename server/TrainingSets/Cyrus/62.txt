You got a lot of girls who know they got it goin' on.
But nothing's ever a comparison to you.
Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want?
And everything I need is everything you do.
And a girl walked by no matter 'cause you're looking so much better.
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy.
She could be a supermodel on every magazine cover.
She'll never ever mean a thing to me.
She's no you, oh, no.
You give me more than I could ever want.
She's no you, oh, no.
I'm satisfied with the one I got.
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed.
She's only a picture on a magazine.
She's no you.
She's no you.
They got a lot of girls that be dancin' in the videos.
But I prefer the way you do the way you move.
You're more than beautiful and I just wanna let you know.
That all I ever need is what I got with you.
And a girl walked by no matter every time you're looking better.
I think you're perfect, there ain't nothing I would change.
She could be a supermodel on every magazine cover.
She'll never ever take my heart away.
She's no you, oh, no.
You give me more than I could ever want.
She's no you, oh, no.
I'm satisfied with the one I got.
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed.
She's only a picture on a magazine.
She's no you.
She's no you.
And no one's ever gonna get to me, no.
The way you do now, baby can't you see.
That you're the one, the only one.
Who's ever made me feel this way.
And nothing's ever coming even close, no.
No one's ever been comparable to you.
Oh, yeah.
I don't want nothing I don't got.
I don't need nothing but you.
I can't get more than you give me.
So don't stop anything you do.
You're all that, all that, and then some.
You know what, just what I need.
And no girl, no place, no where.
Could mean a thing to me.
She's no you, oh, no.
You give me more than I could ever want.
She's no you, oh, no.
I'm satisfied with the one I got.
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed.
She's only a picture on a magazine.
She's no you.
She's no you.
She's no you.
You give me more than I could ever want.
She's no you.
I'm satisfied with the one I got.
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed.
She's only a picture on a magazine.
She's no you.
She's no you, girl.
