Sometimes I couldn't hear what you're trying to tell me.
I thought that I knew all I need to know.
I didn't understand that the doors you would open.
Could take me somewhere I wanted to go.
I can be strong for you now.
You taught me how.
I learned from you that I do not crumble.
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose.
All of the reasons to keep on believin'.
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you.
You know where to find all of my hiding places.
And there are no secrets from you I can keep.
You let me know how you feel, pulling no punches.
And I never knew that kind of honesty.
I'm grateful for all of the times.
You opened my eyes.
I learned from you that I do not crumble.
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose.
All of the reasons to keep on believin'.
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you.
You helped me to stand on my own.
And I thank you for that.
It saved me, it made me.
And now that I'm looking back I can say.
I learned from you that I do not crumble.
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose.
All of the reasons to keep on believin'.
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you.
I do not crumble.
I learned that strength is somethin' you choose.
All of the reasons to keep on believin'.
There's no question, that's a lesson, I learned from you.
I learned from you.
