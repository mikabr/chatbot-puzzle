I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan.
Welcome to the land of fame, excess, whoa am I gotta fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time.
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign.
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous.
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick.
Too much pressure and I'm nervous.
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio.
And the Jay-Z song was on.
And the Jay-Z song was on.
And the Jay-Z song was on.
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song.
The butterflies fly away.
I'm noddin' my head like Yeah!
Movin' my hips like Yeah!
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song.
And now I'm gonna be okay.
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Get to the club in my taxi cab.
Everybody's lookin' at me now.
Like Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks.
She's gotta be from out of town.
So hard with my girls not around me.
It's definitely not a Nashville party.
'Cause all I see are stilettos.
I guess I never got the memo.
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick.
Too much pressure and I'm nervous.
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune.
And the Britney song was on.
And the Britney song was on.
And the Britney song was on.
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song.
The butterflies fly away.
I'm noddin' my head like Yeah!
Movin' my hips like Yeah!
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song.
And now I'm gonna be okay.
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Feel like hoppin' on a flight, on a flight.
Back to my hometown tonight, town tonight.
Something stops me every time, every time.
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright.
So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song.
The butterflies fly away.
I'm noddin' my head like Yeah!
Movin' my hips like Yeah!
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay.
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
