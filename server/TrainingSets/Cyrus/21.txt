La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la


How come everything turns out leaving me with more doubts?

I feel like I'm upside down, and I don't wanna be here

I go right, should have gone left, and I say things I should have not said

Look at me in this big mess, I don't wanna be here


Everything I do is making me more confused

Oh, it used to be easy, all I had to be was me, now I'm mixed up

Everywhere I go is somewhere that I don't know

Oh, I hope that I'm dreaming 'cause I'm sick of this feeling

I'm mixed up, somebody help me


La, la, la, la, la


Tell me how to fix this, I'd trade my world for one wish

To go back to my other life, oh, and get it right


Everything I do is making me more confused

Oh, it used to be easy, all I had to be was me, now I'm mixed up

Everywhere I go is somewhere that I don't know

Oh, I hope that I'm dreaming 'cause I'm sick of this feeling

I'm mixed up, could somebody help me?


To hold me, tell me everything's gonna be okay

'Cause today it feels like I won't make it through the darkness

Don't know how to get outta this

I'm so mixed up, can somebody help me?


La, la, la


Everything I do is making me more confused

Oh, it used to be easy, all I had to be was me, and now I'm mixed up

Everywhere I go is somewhere that I don't know

Oh, I hope that I'm dreaming 'cause I'm sick of this feeling

I'm mixed up, somebody help me, somebody help me
