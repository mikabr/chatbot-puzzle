Artist: Bastien Laval ft. Layla


Good morning, midnight

Hello again.

If I don't close my eyes

Days never end.

Tick tick tock tock

Who's keeping time?

Throw away the stop watch

Losing my mind


I'm so fixed on this high

That I found.

Once you touch the sky

There is no coming down.


Seconds turn to minutes,

And the minutes turn to hours,

And the hours turn to days,

And the world goes round

(And round)


Chorus:


The restlessness,

You're in my head.

I cannot get you out.

Hot on my lips,

Taste of your kiss,

I just can't live without.

The restlessness [x8]


Good morning, sunshine,

You strike a match.

And until the twilight,

Brighten the black.

Wide awake,

But sometimes it seems

Like I'm running backwards

Lost in a dream.

I'm so fixed on this high

That I found.

Once you touch the sky

There is no coming down.


Seconds turn to minutes,

And the minutes turn to hours,

And the hours turn to days,

And the world goes round

(And round)


Chorus:


The restlessness

You're in my head

I cannot get you out

Hot on my lips

Taste of your kiss

I just can't live without

The restlessness[x8]


Seconds turn to minutes,

And the minutes turn to hours,

And the hours turn to days,

And the world goes round

(And round)


Chorus:


The restlessness

You're in my head

I cannot get you out

Hot on my lips

Taste of your kiss

I just can't live without

The restlessness[x4]


Seconds turn to minutes,

And the minutes turn to hours,

And the hours turn to days,

And the world goes round

(And round)


Seconds turn to minutes,

And the minutes turn to hours,

And the hours turn to days,

And the world goes round

(And round)
