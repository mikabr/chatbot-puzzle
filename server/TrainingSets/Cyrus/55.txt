Good morning, midnight.
Hello again.
If I don't close my eyes.
Days never end.
Tick tick tock tock.
Who's keeping time?
Throw away the stop watch.
Losing my mind.
I'm so fixed on this high.
That I found.
Once you touch the sky.
There is no coming down.
Seconds turn to minutes.
And the minutes turn to hours.
And the hours turn to days.
And the world goes round.
The restlessness.
You're in my head.
I cannot get you out.
Hot on my lips.
Taste of your kiss.
I just can't live without.
The restlessness.
Good morning, sunshine.
You strike a match.
And until the twilight.
Brighten the black.
Wide awake.
But sometimes it seems.
Like I'm running backwards.
Lost in a dream.
I'm so fixed on this high.
That I found.
Once you touch the sky.
There is no coming down.
Seconds turn to minutes.
And the minutes turn to hours.
And the hours turn to days.
And the world goes round.
The restlessness.
You're in my head.
I cannot get you out.
Hot on my lips.
Taste of your kiss.
I just can't live without.
Seconds turn to minutes.
And the minutes turn to hours.
And the hours turn to days.
And the world goes round.
The restlessness.
You're in my head.
I cannot get you out.
Hot on my lips.
Taste of your kiss.
I just can't live without.
The restlessness.
Seconds turn to minutes.
And the minutes turn to hours.
And the hours turn to days.
And the world goes round.
Seconds turn to minutes.
And the minutes turn to hours.
And the hours turn to days.
And the world goes round.
