V1

In the world are starving people who need help and

those who have no way to get out

of this tragedy

or no help

some of them have no family

and have no one

to love


Chorus

But if we help (but if we all can help)

We can defeat (We can defeat)

World poverty world poverty


V2

Don't just recognise but help the world today

defeat poverty so we can live in a world

were we are all safe

and no one living on the streets

so we say


Chorus

But if we help (but if we all can help)

We can defeat (We can defeat)

World poverty world poverty


V3

In the world where we live

there are people who have no job

and they see and

hear just like us

but we have a life to live


Chorus

But if we help (but if we all can help)

We can defeat (We can defeat)

World poverty world poverty


V4

If you believe we can achieve

to help the starving and the sick

so make the world a better place to live


Chorus

But if we help (but if we all can help)

We can defeat (We can defeat)

World poverty world poverty


World poverty
