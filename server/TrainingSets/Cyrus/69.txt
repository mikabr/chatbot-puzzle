Something's coming over me.
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.
Every time you're close to me.
I feel the rush, I feel the rush.
Such a sweet taste when we kiss.
It's poisonous, so poisonous.
This could be a tragedy.
I'll take the the risk, I'll take the risk.
Closer, little closer than my heartbeat.
Hold my hand feel me come undone.
Don't hesitate just set yourself free.
got me rising, heartbeat on the sun.
Burning up the night.
Burning up my candle.
Fire in your eyes.
It's more than I can handle.
Burning up the night.
Silently I pray for rain.
Wash over me, wash over me.
So long, gonna melt away.
Can't stand the heat, can't stand the heat.
Closer, little closer than my heartbeat.
Hold my hand feel me come undone.
Don't hesitate just set yourself free.
Got me rising, heartbeat on the sun.
You're burning up the night.
Burning up my candle.
Fire in your eyes.
It's more than I can handle.
You're burning up the night.
It's hard to fight the feeling.
I'm not gonna try.
I just gotta give in.
You're burning up the night.
