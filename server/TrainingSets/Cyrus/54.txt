You told me there's no need to talk it out.
Cause it's too late to proceed.
And slowly I took your words.
And walked away.
No looking back.
I wont regret, no.
I will find my way.
I'm broken.
But still I have to say.
It's Alright, OK.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
Alright, Ok.
So don't you bother what I do.
No matter what you say.
I won't return.
Our bridge has burnt down.
I'm stronger now.
Alright, Ok.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
You played me.
Betrayed me.
Your love was nothing but a game.
Portrait a role.
You took control, I couldn't help but fall.
So deep.
But now I see things clear.
It's Alright, OK.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
Alright, Ok.
So don't you bother what I do.
No matter what you say.
I won't return.
Our bridge has burnt down.
I'm stronger now.
Alright, Ok.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
Don't waist you fiction tears on me.
Just save them for someone in need.
It's Way to late.
I'm closing the door.
It's Alright, OK.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
Alright, Ok.
So don't you bother what I do.
No matter what you say.
I won't return.
Our bridge has burnt down.
I'm stronger now.
Alright, Ok.
I'm so much better without you.
I won't be sorry.
It's alright, OK.
Alright, OK.
We know you.
No matter what you say.
It's alright, OK.
Alright, OK.
Without you I won't be sorry.
