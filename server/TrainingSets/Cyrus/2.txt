You tucked me in, turned out the light.
Kept me safe and sound at night.
Little girls depend on things like that.
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair.
Had to drive me everywhere.
You were always there when I looked back.
You had to do it all alone.
Make a living, make a home.
Must have been as hard as it could be.
And when I couldn't sleep at night.
Scared things wouldn't turn out right.
You would hold my hand and sing to me.
Caterpillar in the tree.
How you wonder who you'll be.
Can't go far but you can always dream.
Wish you may and wish you might.
Don't you worry, hold on tight.
I promise you there will come a day.
Butterfly fly away.
Butterfly fly away, butterfly fly away.
Flap your wings now you can't stay.
Take those dreams and make them all come true.
Butterfly fly away, butterfly fly away.
We've been waiting for this day.
All along and knowing just what to do.
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away.
Butterfly fly away.
Butterfly fly away.
