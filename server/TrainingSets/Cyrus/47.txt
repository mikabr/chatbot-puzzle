Life has a Rating and God is the judge.
If you get a one you will probably be shunned.
If you get a two then you just might get through.
If you get a three, oh baby or almost there.
If you get a four you will get a chance for sho'.
If you get a five that is where you strive, you are half way there.
If you get a six you will probably get a good chance.
If you get a seven you are on your way to heaven.
If you get an eight you can open up those Heaven Gates.
If you get a nine then its almost time.
If you get a TEN you haven't committed almost any sin.
If life has ratings then always try your best.
You do the best you can.
And hope its enough to stand.
You need good friends to help you when you fall.
if your different in the end it doesn't matter at all.
Always be yourself and you are less likely to fall.
God made everyone different because everyone is special.
He made you the way you were and that's the way he wants you.
Believe in his gifts.
Don't doubt his ability.
Live your life to fullest because today could be you last.
You never know what could happen to your friends and family.
Today could be there last day and their last memories.
I know we aren't perfect people.
But we live for the same reason.
To live for our God.
Today could be you last day so make the best.
These are the times you'll remember forever.
And I'll be there for you until the very.
Live to the greatest and remember these words.
God is watching you and he'll punish you.
God is always there for you in hard times.
He'll be your best friend forever.
I hope you enjoy life and that it lasts for a while.
