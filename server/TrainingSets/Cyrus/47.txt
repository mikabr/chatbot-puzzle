Ohh Ohh Ohh

Life has a Rating and God is the judge

If you get a one you will probably be shunned

If you get a two then you just might get through

If you get a three,.oh baby or almost there

If you get a four you will get a chance for sho'

If you get a five that is where you strive, you are half way there

If you get a six you will probably get a good chance

If you get a seven you are on your way to heaven

If you get an eight you can open up those Heaven Gates

If you get a nine then its almost time..

If you get a TEN you haven't committed almost any sin


If life has ratings then always try your best

You do the best you can

And hope its enough to stand

You need good friends to help you when you fall

if your different in the end it doesn't matter at all

Always be yourself and you are less likely to fall


God made everyone different because everyone is special

He made you the way you were and that's the way he wants you


Believe in his gifts

Don't doubt his ability

Live your life to fullest because today could be you last

You never know what could happen to your friends and family

Today could be there last day and their last memories

I know we aren't perfect people

But we live for the same reason

To live for our God

Today could be you last day so make the best

These are the times you'll remember forever

And I'll be there for you until the very

Live to the greatest and remember these words

God is watching you and he'll punish you

God is always there for you in hard times

He'll be your best friend forever

I hope you enjoy life and that it lasts for a while,,
