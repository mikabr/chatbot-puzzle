We both lie silently still.
In the dead of the night.
Although we both lie close together.
We feel miles apart inside.
Was it something I said or something I did.
Did my words not come out right.
Though I tried not to hurt you.
Ya, I tried but I guess that's why they say.
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does.
I listen to our favorite song.
Playing on the radio.
Hear the DJ say love's a game.
Of easy come and easy go.
But I wonder, does he know.
Has he ever felt like this.
And I know that you'd be here right now.
If I, I could let you know somehow.
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn.
Though it's been a while now.
I can still feel so much pain.
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals.
But the scar, that scar will remain.
Every rose, every rose.
Every rose has its thorn.
I know I could have saved a love that night.
If I'd known what to say.
Instead of makin' love.
We both made our separate ways.
And now I hear you found somebody new.
And that I never meant that much to you.
To hear that tears me up inside.
And to see you cuts me like a knife.
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn.
