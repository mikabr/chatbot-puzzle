Yeah the rumors are true.
I’m deleted my twitter.
Uh, can you believe?
I got 2-2 million friends.
I’ve set out here.
Coz I had to say goodbye.
And this little rap is to tell my friends why?
Uh-uh.
No it wasn’t because my friends told me to.
You all know very well.
What you say I don’t do.
And the reasons are simple.
I started tweeting by pimples.
I stopped living for moments.
And started living for people.
Yeah your right what you doing.
But who really cares?
If I m playing with my work.
Or just doing my hair.
Everything that I type.
And everything that I do.
All those lame gossip sites.
Take it & they make it news.
I want my private life private.
I’m done trying to please.
I ain't living for tablets.
No I'm living for me.
No more emo quotes.
No staying tune with demi.
Yeah.
Yeah I’ve done all that.
And the truth is I’m too busy.
Yeah I gotta admit that I’m with Dane cooks tweets.
And I really like looking at Katy Perry’s & Britney's.
I need it, I know it hurts.
Coz I was a little obsessed.
But I’m peacing out.
And I’m leaving with dis.
Ah-ah yeah.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Freaky-freaky freak out!!
