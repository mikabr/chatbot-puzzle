Everybody needs inspiration.
Everybody needs a song.
A beautiful melody when the night's so long.
'Cause there is no guarantee that this life is easy.
Yeah, when my world is falling apart.
When there's no light to break up the dark.
That's when I, I, I look at you.
When the waves are flooding the shore.
And I can't find my way home anymore.
That's when I, I, I look at you.
When I look at you, I see forgiveness, I see the truth.
You love me for who I am like the stars hold the moon.
Right there where they belong.
And I know I'm not alone.
Yeah, when my world is falling apart.
When there's no light to break up the dark.
That's when I, I, I look at you.
When the waves are flooding the shore.
And I can't find my way home anymore.
That's when I, I, I look at you.
You appear just like a dream to me.
Just like kaleidoscope colors that prove to me.
All I need, every breath that I breathe.
Don't ya know, you're beautiful.
Yeah, yeah.
When the waves are flooding the shore.
And I can't find my way home anymore.
That's when I, I, I look at you.
I look at you.
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh.
You appear just like a dream to me.
