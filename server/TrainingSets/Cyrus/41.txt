Finally, I've been waiting for this moment.
For you to see the real me.
It's been an illusion but I never meant to fool you.
I got caught up in a fantasy.
I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me.
In a world that believes fame is everything, yeah, yeah.
Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly.
People say that the world is like a stage.
Yes, I confused the roles I play.
I've been away from home for so long.
That I, I almost forgot where I belong, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me, yeah.
In a world that believes fame is everything.
Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly.
It's so easy to forget what really matters in this life.
It's so hard to live with regrets but I promise I will try.
To be a better me from now on.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do you wrong.
I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me, yeah, yeah.
In a world that believes fame is everything.
Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly.
To fly, to fly.
You give me my wings so I can fly, I can fly, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just a girl.
