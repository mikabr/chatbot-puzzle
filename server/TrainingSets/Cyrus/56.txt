Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Im begging of you please don't take my man

Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare

With flaming locks of auburn hair

With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring

Your voice is soft like summer rain

And I cannot compete with you, jolene


He talks about you in his sleep

There's nothing I can do to keep

From crying when he calls your name, jolene


And I can easily understand

How you could easily take my man

But you don't know what he means to me, jolene


Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Im begging of you please don't take my man

Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Please don't take him just because you can


You could have your choice of men

But I could never love again

Hes the only one for me, jolene


I had to have this talk with you

My happiness depends on you

And whatever you decide to do, jolene


Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Im begging of you please don't take my man

Jolene, jolene, jolene, jolene

Please don't take him even though you can

Jolene, jolene
