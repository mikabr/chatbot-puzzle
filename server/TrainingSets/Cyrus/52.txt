Verse 1:

You're standing in the cold,

You are on your own.

But what feels so strange,

Is you don't feel alone.

Hear your name get called.

Everyone has to fall.

I have been installed,

Do you mind at all?  

Standing in the street, 

I'm messing with your mind.

Stare down at your feet,

It's me you need to find.


Bridge:

Have I reached the bottom?

Of your heart?

Of your mind?

Of your soul?

Yet?


Chorus:

Even if you run I'm still here.

It's me that you need to fear.

But on the bright side now.

You are not alone.


Verse 2:

Listen to your heart,

It beats like thunder.

This is only the start,

Youre going under.

All you have to do,

Is find me.

How long will it take you,

To see?

Dont just waste time,

Put down the phone.

Police arent needed Im not a crime,

I wont leave you alone.


Bridge:

Im sorry does this scare you?

Are you scared?

Are you cold?

Are you weak?

Yet?


Chorus:

Even if you run I'm still here.

It's me that you need to fear.

But on the bright side now.

You are not alone.


Chorus #2:

And just look over there,

Yeah just stare.

I am here.

And you are not alone!


Breakdown:

Its taken a while.

But youve won the finale.

Have I changed?

Ive rearranged.

Its all for you.

I said I would do.

Open your eyes.

Look at the sun rise.

I am not the same.

But you are to blame.

Dont listen to that.

Now you remember that.

You are not alone.


Chorus:

Even if you run I'm still here.

It's me that you need to fear.

But on the bright side now.

You are not alone.


Chorus #2:

And just look over there,

Yeah just stare.

I am here.

And you are not alone!


Quietly:

Just remember that.

You are not alone.
