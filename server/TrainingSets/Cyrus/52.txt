You're standing in the cold.
You are on your own.
But what feels so strange is you don't feel alone.
Hear your name get called.
Everyone has to fall.
I have been installed.
Do you mind at all?
Standing in the street, I'm messing with your mind.
Stare down at your feet.
It's me you need to find.
Have I reached the bottom?
Of your heart?
Of your mind?
Of your soul?
Yet?
Even if you run I'm still here.
It's me that you need to fear.
But on the bright side now.
You are not alone.
Listen to your heart.
It beats like thunder.
This is only the start.
You're going under.
All you have to do is find me.
How long will it take you to see?
Don't just waste time.
Put down the phone.
Police aren't needed I'm not a crime.
I won't leave you alone.
I'm sorry does this scare you?
Are you scared?
Are you cold?
Are you weak?
Yet?
Even if you run I'm still here.
It's me that you need to fear.
But on the bright side now.
You are not alone.
And just look over there.
Yeah just stare.
I am here.
And you are not alone!
It's taken a while.
But you've won the finale.
Have I changed?
I've rearranged.
It's all for you.
I said I would do.
Open your eyes.
Look at the sun rise.
I am not the same.
But you are to blame.
Don't listen to that.
Now you remember that.
You are not alone.
Even if you run I'm still here.
It's me that you need to fear.
But on the bright side now.
You are not alone.
And just look over there.
Yeah just stare.
I am here.
And you are not alone!
Just remember that.
You are not alone.
