I don’t wanna lie, I’m gonna take what you’re giving.
Cause I know you’re willing, to take me all the way.. You got me right here.
Combustible. And I can’t wait to finally explode.
The Big Big Bang, the reason I’m alive.
When all the Stars collide, in this Universe inside.
The Big Big Bang, The Big Big Bang, The Big Big Bang.
Some people like to talk. But I’m into doing What I feel like doing, when I’m inspired.
So if we take a walk down, the beach tonight, I bet we could light up the sky. The Big Big Bang, the reason I’m alive.
When all the stars collide,in this Universe inside.
The Big Big Bang, The Big Big Bang.
The Big Big Bang. Take it from me.
I don’t wanna be, mummified, sometimes I feel so isolated.
I wanna die. And now take it from me, if you got it.
Every time, so baby, bring your body here, next to mine.
Next to Mine! I don’t wanna dream! Hmmmm I just wanna live!
So baby,lets not miss this thing! The Big Big Bang, the reason.
I'm alive, when all the Stars collide,in this Universe inside.The Big Big Bang, The Big Big Bang, The Big Big Bang.
Big Big Big Bang, Oh babe, oh babe, oh babe.
