So I guess I just let the silver rain,

Fall down on my face

And wash away the pain


And I guess that I will always carry your heart,

Carry the blame,

I don't know what to do, you keep leaving me, and I keep cursing on you.

Its 3 am and your sleeping sound,

But I lay wide-awake, thinking

Why I am so broken,


I wanna move on a go,

You said I'm week and it shows

And the silver lined cloud blows,


Silver rain, oh I guess ill just let the.

Silver rain; fall down on my face,

Let it wash away the pain.

Oh, ill keep my window open,

I really hope you come in, with the silver rain.


Ill let, you bring me down for now,

But I would let you play me, like a rag doll

You wont get away with much anymore.


I'm stronger then I was before.

You hurt the wrong kinda heart, you tore it apart

Now I'm sitting in my empty bed, all alone,

Watching my room flood with


Silver rain, oh I guess ill just let the.

Silver rain; fall down on my face,

Let it wash away the pain.

Oh, ill keep my window open,

I really hope you come in, with the silver rain.


I said I wanna move on and go

You said I'm week and it shows

Before you give me that rose,

I fly away with the crows,

Just so nobody knows,

What kinda path I chose


Gotta learn to live without you.


Silver rain, oh I guess ill just let the.

Silver rain; fall down on my face,

Let it wash away the pain.

Oh, ill keep my window open,

I really hope you come in, with the silver rain.
