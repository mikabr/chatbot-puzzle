Oh, can we take care of her?

Oh, maybe you can spare her

Several moments of your consideration

Leading up to the final destination

Oh, the earth is calling out

I wanna learn what it's all about


But everything I read

'Global warming', 'going green'

I don't know what all this means

But it seems to be saying


Wake up, America

We're all in this together

It's our home so let's take care of it

You know that you want to

You know that you got to


Wake up, America

Tomorrow becomes a new day

And everything you do matters

Yeah, everything you do matters in some way


Stand up, I'll try if you will

Wake up, it's not a fire drill

All she needs is a little attention

Can you give her just a little attention?

Oh, it's easy to walk away

But it's getting harder day by day


Everything I read

'Global warming', 'going green'

I don't know what all this means

But it seems to be saying


C'mon, wake up, America

We're all in this together

It's our home so let's take care of it

You know that you want to

You know that you got to


Wake up, America

Tomorrow becomes a new day

And everything you do matters

Yeah, everything you do matters in some way


I know that you don't wanna hear it

Especially coming from someone so young

But in the backseat, yeah

They wanna hear it


So come on, turn it up

Come on, turn it up

So come on, turn it up


Wake up, America

We're all in this together

It's our home so let's take care of it

You know that you want to

You know that you got to


Wake up, America

Tomorrow becomes a new day

And everything you do matters

Yeah, everything you do matters in some way
