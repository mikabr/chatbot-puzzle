When I feel all alone.
And nobody knows.
Still got a smile for a while.
I can't let it show.
Dry my tears.
Hide my fears.
And when i'm backstage.
Feelin' down and the lights come on no time to worry.
Gotta hurry.
Gotta sing my song.
Gotta shake it off.
Snap my fingers just like that.
Don't get what I want.
And that's a fact.
Snap my fingers just like that.
Don't get what I want.
I'm super cool.
Super hot.
Livin like a rockstar.
You think I'm super.
You think I'm super.
On the cover of your magazines.
Wherever I go they.
Make a scene.
I'm super super.
I'm super duper.
So you wanna be just like.
So you wanna be just like.
Think you wanna be just.
Like me.
Everybody's watching me.
It's never as easy as it seems.
To be super super.
To be super super girl.
When I walk in the room.
Everybody stops.
Camras flashing.
People fighting.
For the best shot.
They like my hair.
The clothes I wear.
Everybody wants to know.
What I'm doin next.
Sometimes I wish I could.
Stay home.
Just be by myself.
I wanna be.
More carefree.
Can't you see.
Snap my fingers just like that.
Don't get what I want.
And that's a fact.
Snap my fingers just like that.
Don't get what I want.
I'm super cool.
super hot.
Livin like a rockstar.
You think i'm super.
You think i'm super.
On the cover of.
Your magazines.
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super.
I'm super duper.
So you wanna be just like.
So you wanna be just like.
Think you wanna be just.
Like me.
Everbody's watching me.
It's never as easy as it seems.
To be super super.
To be super super girl.
Wish you could see.
I'm like everybody else.
Struggling to let go.
And always be myself.
I'm super cool.
Super hot.
Super.
