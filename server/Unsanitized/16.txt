Oh yea

Come on


You get the limo out front

Hottest styles, every shoe, every color


Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun

It's really you but no one ever discovers


In some ways you're just like all your friends

But on stage you're a star


You get the best of both worlds

Chillin' out, take it slow

Then you rock out the show


You get the best of both worlds

Mix it all together and you know that

It's the best of both worlds

The best of both worlds


You go the movie premiers

(Is that Orlando Bloom?)

Hear your songs on the radio

Livin' two lives is a little weird

But school's cool cuz nobody knows


Yea you get to be a small town girl

But big time when you play your guitar


You get the best of both worlds

Chillin' out take it slow

Then you rock out the show


You get the best of both worlds

Mix it all together and you know that

It's the best of both

You know the best of both worlds


Pictures and autographs

You get your face in all the magazines

The best part's that

You get to be who ever you wanna be


Yea best of both

You get the best of both

Come on, best of both


Who would of thought that a girl like me

Would double as a superstar?


You get the best of both worlds

Chillin' out, take it slow

Then you rock out the show


You get the best of both worlds

Mix it all together and you know that

It's the best


You get the best of both worlds

Without the shades and the hair

You can go anywhere


You get the best of both girls

Mix it all together

Oh yea

It's so much better cuz you know

You've got the best of both worlds
