Miley:


I know this isn't what I wanted,

Never thought it'd come this far,

Just thinking back to where we started

& how we lost all that we are


Nick:


We were young & times were easy,

But I could see it's not the same.

I'm standing here, but you don't see me,

I'd give it all for that to change.

And I don't want to lose her,

I don't want to let her go.


Miley:


I'm standing out in the rain,

I need to know if its over,

Cause I will leave you alone.


Nick:


Flooded with all this pain,

Knowing that I'll never hold her,


Nick & Miley:


Like I did before the storm


nick:

yeah


miley:

before the storm


Nick:


And with every strike of lightning


Miley:


Comes a memory that lasts


Nick & Miley:


Not a word is left unspoken 

As the thunder starts to crash


Miley:


Maybe I should give up


Miley:


I'm standing out in the rain,

I need to know if its over,

Cause I will leave you alone.


Nick:


Flooded with all this pain,

Knowing that I'll never hold her,


Nick & Miley:


Like I did before the storm


Miley:


Trying to keep the light from going in


Nick & Miley:


And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.

We always say a heart is not whole 

Without the one who gets you through the storm.


Nick & Miley:


Standing out in the rain, 

Knowing that it's really over- 

Please don't leave me alone


I'm flooded with all this pain, 

Knowing that I'll never hold you,

Like I did before the storm 


Miley: 


Like I did...


Nick & Miley: 


Before the storm
