Don't keep me waiting, anticipating

Treating me like a fool

I got news for you, I'm turning my back

I'm dropping a bomb on you


You want me, you need me

Believe me, you'll be callin'

You love me, you hate me

Believe me, you'll come crawlin'


So get down, and get it off

Let me show you what you'll be missing

We break up, you break down

Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming


Don't keep me guessing, I'm your favorite obsession

Don't get me that lame excuse

Is it me that you're missing? It's that same old confession

You're the one with something to lose


Watch out now, so glad now

There's no doubt, you can't have it

Control you, I'll own you

I'll show you, but you still can't have it


So get down, and get it off

I'ma show you what you'll be missing

We break up, you break down

Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming


So get down, and get it off

You're not the only one that I've been missing

We break up, you break down

Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming


You'll be kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming

I'm so deceiving

You'll be kicking and screaming


Watch out now, you'll find out

You'll cry out, there's no one above me

I play hard, don't run far

Come back now, I really do like you


So get down, and get it off

I'ma show you what you'll be missing

We break up, you break down

Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming


So get down, and get it off

You're not the only one that I've been missing

We break up, you break down

Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming


You'll be kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming

Kicking and screaming

Kicking and screaming
