[Nicki Minaj's Verse].
OK, guess who got that mhm-mhm nani-nani.
In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami.
Whiz Galliano, whip-whip the Armani.
In the drip-drip, lick-lick like a Lolly.
Or, left from Jamaica, going foreign couture.
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Wali and Dior.
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior.
But that was before, or, for you.
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you?.
You can do anything you put your mind to.
Way you French kiss it, "Français parlez vous".
Way you work your tongue can I hire you?.
.
