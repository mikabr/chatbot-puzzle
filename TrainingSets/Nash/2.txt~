In society, power is often transferred to another person or group. A previous work studied the evolution of cooperation among robot players through a coalition formation game with a non-cooperative procedure of acceptance of an agency of another player. Motivated by this previous work, we conduct a laboratory experiment on finitely repeated three-person coalition formation games. Human players with different strength according to the coalition payoffs can accept a transfer of power to another player, the agent, who then distributes the coalition payoffs. We find that the agencies method for coalition formation is quite successful in promoting efficiency. However, the agent faces a tension between short-term incentives of not equally distributing the coalition payoff and the long-term concern to keep cooperation going. In a given round, the strong player in our experiment often resolves this tension approximately in line with the Shapley value and the nucleolus. Yet aggregated over all rounds, the payoff differences between players are rather small, and the equal division of payoffs predicts about 80% of all groups best. One reason is that the voting procedure appears to induce a balance of power, independent of the individual player's strength: Selfish subjects tend to be voted out of their agency and are further disciplined by reciprocal behaviors.

For a long time the focus of attention in the analysis of coalition formation has been cooperative game theory. One underlying idea of cooperative game theory is that there are no restrictions on how agreements can be reached among players. The coalition formation process, making offers and counteroffers, can thus remain largely unspecified. In our cooperative games it is to the joint benefit of the group to form the grand coalition. Yet, which allocation of the corresponding coalition value is agreeable to all players? We mostly focus on three solution concepts of cooperative game theory: the core, Shapley value, and nucleolus.

Loosely speaking, divisions of the total return are called points of the core if they are stable in the sense that no coalition should have the desire and power to upset the agreement. If, e.g., a coalition of two members is assigned a smaller total payoff in the grand coalition proposal than what the two members coalition can achieve alone, this proposal is inherently instable and thus not in the core. However, one problem is that the core can consist of many points without distinguishing a preferred point, or it may even be empty. The Shapley value (22), on the other hand, assigns to each player a unique payoff (“value”), which may be interpreted as a measure of power of the respective player in the game. One way of arriving at the Shapley value is to suppose that the grand coalition is formed by each player entering into this coalition one by one. As each player enters, he receives a payoff equal to his marginal contribution to the grand coalition payoff. This contribution generally depends on the entering order. The Shapley value is the average payoff to the players if they enter in a random order.‡ The nucleolus (23) is neither based on a stability concept like the core nor characterized by principles of power or fairness like the Shapley value. Rather it finds a unique solution of a cooperative game by computing the maximum dissatisfaction with a given allocation across all possible coalitions and then finding the allocation that minimizes the maximum dissatisfaction. So, loosely speaking, the nucleolus serves the most dissatisfied players first. (Dissatisfaction is measured by the maximum total payoff a coalition can reach minus the actual total payoff assigned by the allocation. The nucleolus is always in core, if nonempty.)

We discuss the performance of these solution concepts for our games in the next section (see Table 1 and Fig. 2 for the quantitative solutions for our base games and the theoretical discussion of the solution concepts in SI Text A, SI Text B, and Table S1).

Built on Nash’s seminal papers in 1950 (24), since the 1980s there have been many attempts to understand coalition formation and the distributions of payoffs as equilibria of non-cooperative games (25⇓–27 and references therein). Starting in the field of industrial organization, extensive game models of oligopolistic competition and the analysis of their subgame perfect equilibria (28, 29) turned out to be a fruitful approach. Harsanyi’s theory of incomplete information (30) opened further opportunities for non-cooperative game models. Somewhat later non-cooperative game modeling spread to many other fields of economic theory and much less attention was paid to cooperative games. There are exceptions. One is the “Gale–Shapley algorithm” (31) that rather recently turned out to be useful in practical market design; Roth (32) surveys the literature. However, the earliest attempt to develop non-cooperative modeling of cooperation and bargaining was by Nash (33) on two-person bargaining. There he not only presented his axiomatic theory but also offered a non-cooperative interpretation. Both Nash’s model (1) and our agencies method ultimately build on this non-cooperative approach.

A description of a strategic situation as a non-cooperative game is much more detailed than for a cooperative game. For experimental purposes an extensive game procedure for coalition bargaining, as we have devised it, has the advantage that the players interact in a formal and anonymous way. Thereby one isolates the strategic situation from social influences like personal sympathies and easily protocols every decision. However, any coalition (including no coalition with zero payoffs for all) can be supported in a pure equilibrium of our base game. The final agent who can be any of the three players takes the entire coalition value. When repeating the base game, as in our experiment, non-cooperative game theory imposes even less structure on behavior and outcomes: In the supergame almost any payoff division can be chosen in equilibrium, supported by a threat to convert to a one-shot base game equilibrium with no acceptances of any player in case of a deviation from the equilibrium path (SI Text A). Thus, it is not possible to derive predictions from non-cooperative game theory. [The complexity involved in analyzing supergames was first emphasized by Nash in the context of the theoretically much less demanding repeated prisoner’s dilemma (34) and has been confirmed in the laboratory (35⇓–37).]

We find that the agencies method for coalition formation is an effective mechanism to promote efficient cooperation and balanced payoffs. In particular, we observe that even though the players’ strengths differ, long-run payoffs aggregated over all rounds tend to converge to the equal division. This is consistent with Nash’s (1) simulations with robots in a similar context, as well as with parts of the behavioral economics literature, indicating a general attraction for payoff equality in bargaining and cooperation games, especially when payoff comparisons between players are possible.

However, equality is not generally the leading principle in each round separately. Here, many agencies seem to succumb to short-term incentives and allocate a significantly larger portion of the payoffs to themselves. Yet, they generally resist taking the whole surplus, as would have been predicted by non-cooperative game theory for the one-shot version of the game. Rather, in the short run, many agents appear to be guided by strength comparisons as captured by the Shapley value and the nucleolus. So, although there is inequality at many snapshots, some of which is organized by cooperative game theory, the repeated and symmetric voting procedure makes sure that, ultimately, everybody is taken care of equally—even to the extent that it mitigates strong differences in the subjects’ strengths.
