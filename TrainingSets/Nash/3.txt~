The path space described here provides a very simple demonstration of the
topological invariance of the Stiefel-Whitney classes for a differentiable manifold
M. This invariance has been proved by other means by R. Thom.'
Actually, Thom proves a more general result, which implies the topological
invariance of these classes. He shows that the fiber homotopy type of the tangent
bundle of M depends only on the topological structure of M. Because the Stiefel-
Whitney classes are dependent only on the fiber homotopy type of the tangent
bundle, their topological invariance follows.
The path space we introduce is regarded as a fiber space2 over M, and it turns out
to have the same fiber homotopy type as the tangent bundle. Since the definition of
the path space is purely topological, the general result of Thom follows immedi-
ately. Also, one sees directly that the Stiefel-Whitney classes have an analogue for
manifolds without differentiability structure.
