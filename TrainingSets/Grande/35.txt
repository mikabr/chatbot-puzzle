You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind
Playing truth or dare
Daring me to kiss you right here

Though we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me
Do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down
If we get too close

Ahhhhh
But if we get too close
Ahhhhh
Down if we get too close

Remember that girl
That you used to date
She with my ex-boyfriend
That's great
So what would you do
What would you say
If I said I loved you that way?

Though we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me
Do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down
If we get too close

Ahhhhh
But if we get too close
Ahhhhh
Down if we get too close

But I just can't let it show

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me
Do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down
If we get too close

[2x]
Ahhhhh
But if we get too close
Ahhhhh
Down if we get too close
