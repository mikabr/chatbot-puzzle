If you're looking for love

Know that love don't live here anymore

He left with my heart

They both walked through that door, without me

If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else

Cause I surely can't help you

I'm hurting myself

I've turned into someone else


I used to believe the comfort

That's what seen in movies

Come to find out it's not like that at all

You see real life's much different


I don't want to see you go

Only want to see you smile

It hurts so much just thinking of

Felt like this for awhile

I can't stand to see you there

We cried we lied

Cannot pretend to change the fact

That what we had could make us feel alive again

Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope

Tell me that now is not the end


If you're looking for love

Know that love don't live here anymore

He left with my heart

They both walked through that door, without me

If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else

Cause I surely can't help you

I'm hurting myself

I've turned into someone else


I used to believe love conquers all

Cause that's what I felt when you held me

I thought you'd catch me if I fall

And fill me up when I'm empty


I don't want to see you go

Only want to see you smile

It hurts so much just thinking of

Felt like this for awhile

I can't stand to see you there

We cried we lied

Cannot pretend to change the fact

That what we had could make us feel alive again

Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope

Tell me that now is not the end


If you're looking for love

Know that love don't live here anymore

He left with my heart

They both walked through that door, without me

If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else

Cause I surely can't help you

I'm hurting myself

I've turned into someone else


Love is patient

Love is selfless

Love is hopeful

Love is god

Love is jealous

Love is selfish

Love is helpless

Love is blind


Love is patient

Love is selfless

Love is hopeful

Love is god

Love is jealous

Love is selfish

Love is helpless

Love is blind


Love is patient

Love is selfless

Love is hopeful

Love is god

Love is jealous

Love is selfish

Love is helpless

Love is blind


I've turned into someone else
