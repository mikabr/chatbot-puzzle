Put on your coolest dress

And your hottest pair of shoes

Come on lets go, oh


Get in my car

Turn the radio on up high

I said high

At the red light

Boys trying to get the digits

But we sneak by, bbbbb by

Cuz were heading to the club

Nothing gonna stop us now

Let’s go (let’s go, let’s go)

Oh


CHORUS

Are you ready? X3

Let’s go

Are you ready? x3

Let’s go

Are you ready? Are you 

YEAH

I'm coming up with all my girls

Were gonna party like there’s never a worry Cuz

Good time rules, so no curfew

Were showing all our moves the breeze so cool

Let your hair down

Tonight you get to be a superstar

You’re living like a superstar……………


So were flirting with the dude

At the door till he says were okay hey

Move the velvet rope

Back off, get out of our way hey (Come on Come on)

All the guys got their eyes on us

As were moving up to the floor (to the flooooor)

Trying to waste some time

But were doing what we came here for


CHORUS


We get red carpet love

When we come stepping up

The boys keep dropping their jaws

Can never get enough

We make them stop and stare

We see them everywhere

And now you know who we are

Tonight you’re living like a superstar


Are you ready? X3

Let’s go

Are you ready? x3

Let’s go

Are you ready? Are you 

YEAH

I'm coming up with all my girls

Were gonna party like there’s never a worry Cuz

Good time rules, so no curfew

Were showing all our moves the breeze so cool

YEAH

I'm coming up with all my girls

Were gonna party like there’s never a worry Cuz

Good time rules, so no curfew

Were showing all our moves the breeze so cool

Let your hair down

Tonight you get to be a superstar

You’re living like a superstar……………

Tonight you get to get to get to get to be a be a

You’re living like a superstar……………
