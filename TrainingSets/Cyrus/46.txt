When I feel all alone

And nobody knows

Still got a smile for a while

I can't let it show

Dry my tears

[Dry my tears]

Hide my fears

[Hide my fears]

And when i'm backstage

Feelin' down 

And the lights come on

No time to worry

Gotta hurry

Gotta sing my song

Gotta shake it off

[shake it off] 

 strike a pose

[Here I go]

Snap my fingers just like that

Don't get what I want

And that's a fact

Snap my fingers just like that

Don't get what I want

[Just cause I want it]

I'm super cool

Super hot

Livin like a rockstar

You think i'm super

You think i'm super

On the cover of

Your magazines

Wherever I go they

Make a scene

I'm super super

I'm super duper

So you wanna be just like

So you wanna be just like

Think you wanna be just

Like me

Everybody's watching me

It's never as easy as it seems

To be super super

To be super super girl

When I walk in the room

Everybody stops

Camras flashing

People fighting

For the best shot

They like my hair

[like my hair]

The clothes I wear

[clothes I wear]

Everybody wants to know

What I'm doin next

Sometimes I wish I could

Stay home

Just be by myself

I wanna be

[wanna be]

More carefree

Can't you see

Snap my fingers just like that

Don't get what I want

And that's a fact

Snap my fingers just like that

Don't get what I want

[just cause I want it]

I'm super cool

super hot

Livin like a rockstar

You think i'm super

You think i'm super

On the cover of

Your magazines

Wherever I go they

Make a scene

I'm super super

I'm super duper

So you wanna be just like

So you wanna be just like

Think you wanna be just

Like me

Everbody's watching me

It's never as easy as it seems

To be super super

To be super super girl

Wish you could see

I'm like everybody else

Struggling to let go

And always be myself

I'm super cool

Super hot

Super

I'm super super

I'm super super

On the cover

Of your magazines

Wherever I go they

Make a scene

I'm super super

I'm super super

So you wanna be just like

So you wanna be just like

Think you wanna be just

Like me

Everybody's watching me

It's never as easy as it seems

To be super super

To be super super girl
