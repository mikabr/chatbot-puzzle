Finally, I've been waiting for this moment

For you to see the real me

It's been an illusion but I never meant to fool you

I got caught up in a fantasy


I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me

In a world that believes fame is everything, yeah, yeah

Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly


People say that the world is like a stage

Yes, I confused the roles I play

I've been away from home for so long

That I, I almost forgot where I belong, yeah, yeah, yeah


I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me, yeah

In a world that believes fame is everything

Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly


It's so easy to forget what really matters in this life

It's so hard to live with regrets but I promise I will try

To be a better me from now on

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do you wrong


I'm just a girl with a dream that got the best of me, yeah, yeah

In a world that believes fame is everything

Got out of touch with the ones who gave me my wings to fly, to fly

To fly, to fly


You give me my wings so I can fly, I can fly, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just a girl
