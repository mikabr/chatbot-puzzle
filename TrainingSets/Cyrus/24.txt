smooth talking,so rocking

he's got everything that a girls wanting

guitar cutie he plays it groovy 

and i can't keep myself from doing something stupid


think I'm really falling for his smile

get butterflies when says my name

he's got  something special[x2]

and when he's looking at me


i wanna get all sentimental

he's got something special [x2]

i can hardly breathe something

telling me [x2]


maybe he could be the one

he could be the one

he could be the one oh,oh,oh

he could be the one [x2]

he could be the one oh,oh,oh


he's lightning sparks are flying

everywhere i go he's always on my mind and

I'm going crazy about him lately

and i can't help myself from now

my heart is racing think I'm really digging on his vibe


he really blows me away

he's got something special [x2]

and when he's looking at me

i wanna get all sentimental


he's got something special [x2]

i can hardly breathe something

telling me [x2]

maybe he could be the one he

he could be the one [x5]


and he's got away 

of making me feel

like everything i do is

perfectly fine the stars are aligned


when I'm with him 

and that's all into him 

he's got something special [x2]

and when he's looking at me


i wanna get all sentimental 

he's got something special [x2]

i can hardly breathe something

telling me [x2]


maybe he could be the one

he could be the one [x6]
