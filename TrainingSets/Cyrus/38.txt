Boom clap, boom de clap de clap

1, 2, 3!

Everybody come on, off your seats

I'm gonna tell you about a beat

That's gonna make you move your feet


I'll give the BBQ

Show and tell you how to move

If you're 5 or 82

This is something you can do


Pop it, lock it, polka dot it

Country fivin', hip hop hip

Put your arms in the sky, move side to side

Jump to the left, stick it, glide


Zig zag 'cross the floor

Shuffle in diagonal

When the drum hits hands on your hips

One-footed 180 twist


And then a zig zag, step, slide

Lean in left, clap three times

Shake it out, head to toe

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


We get to four, five, six

And you're feelin' busted

But it's not time to quit

Practice makes you perfect


Pop it, lock it, polka dot it

Country fivin', hip hop hip

Put your arms in the sky, move side to side

Jump to the left, stick it, glide


Zig zag 'cross the floor

Shuffle in diagonal

When the drum hits hands on your hips

One-footed 180 twist


And then a zig zag, step, slide

Lean in left, clap three times

Shake it out, head to toe

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Boom de clap de clap, boom boom clap

Come on, here we go!

Boom boom clap, boom de clap de clap

Boom boom clap, boom de clap


Pop it, lock it, polka dot it

Country fivin', hip hop hip

Put your arms in the sky, move side to side

Jump to the left, stick it, glide


Zig zag 'cross the floor

Shuffle in diagonal

When the drum hits hands on your hips

One-footed 180 twist


And then a zig zag, step, slide

Lean in left, clap three times

Shake it out, head to toe

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Do the hoedown

(Throwdown!)

Throw it all together, that's how we roll


Boom dap clap, b-boom de clap clap clap

Boom dap clap, b-boom de clap clap

Boom de clap, boom de clap de clap

Throw it all together, that's how we roll
