"() indicates them singing together"


[Billy]: Shes gotta do what shes gotta do

         And I've got to like it or not

         Shes got dreams to big for this town

         And she needs to give them a shot

         Wherever they are

[Miley]: Looks like Im all ready to leave 

         With nothing left to pack 

[Billy]: Aint no room for me in that car 

         Even if she asks me to tag along 

          (God I gotta be strong) 


[Miley]: Im at the startin line 

         Of the rest of my life 

         As ready as Ive ever been 

         Got the hunger and stars in my eyes 

         The prize is mine to win 

[Billy]: Shes waitin on my blessings  

         Before she hits that open road 

         Baby get ready get set dont go 


[Miley]: Looks like things are fallin in place 

[Billy]: Feels like there fallin apart 

         I painted this big old smile on my face 

         To hide my broken heart, if only she knew 

[Miley]: This is where you dont say what u want so bad to say 

[Billy]: This is where I want to but I wont get in the way  

         Of her in her dreams and spreading her wings 

      *Miley is the the backgrounds singing "im ready to fly"

 

[Miley]: Im at the startin line 

         Of the rest of my life 

         As ready as Ive ever been

         The prize is mine to win 

[Billy]: Shes waitin on my blessings  

         Before she hits that open road 

         Baby get ready get set (dont go)


[Miley]: Im at the startin line
