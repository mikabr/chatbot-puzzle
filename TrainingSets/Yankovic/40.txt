.
They only show you their gums when they smile.
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now how vile.
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce.
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss.
.
Hey, stand up.
Toothless people, the breath is lethal.
Wanna tell ya.
.
Hey, (come on), stand up, (get on your feet).
Toothless people, old and feeble.
What I say.
.
No more of those pearly whites will they posses.
Their oral hygiene is frightful a mess.
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease.
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities.
.
Hey, stand up, (take out your teeth).
Toothless people, old and feeble.
Oh yes.
.
You can brush 'em. You can floss 'em .
They're something you just can't ignore.
If you lose 'em your in trouble.
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more.
.
You need something to show your dentist.
The next time he makes you say ahh.
You don't wanna have to wind up.
Eating all of your food through a straw.
.
(Like toothless people).
(Toothless people).
.
You better brush your teeth now.
Hey.
Toothless toothless toothless toothless people….
